Not to be outdone by his own recordings, Bowie also takes his material and reinvents it again depending on what he was doing musically in any given decade. For example, \"Fame\" morphed from the disco seventies to the big, layered sound of the eighties to the industrial noise of the nineties.How does one even begin to pay musical tribute to an ever-changing artist?San Francisco-based Rebel Rebel seek to tackle such a task with their own brand of fearless experimentation and reckless abandon. With Rebel Rebel, the emphasis is on adventure and feeling over simply recreating a song. Mixing well-known tunes with deep album cuts, Rebel Rebel seeks to entertain both the casual listener and die-hard Bowie fanatic.You know the songs. You've loved them for years...But you've never heard them this way.",

  "artistSummary": "Up a dead end street just before you twist and turn your way up to majestic Mount Washington is a house of stairs and weeds and strays of all kinds. A large iguana remains perma-frozen in time on a brick wall, guarding a small iron door. Sparse and small, a place where time doesn’t matter and solitude is king.\n\nCharles Francis Moothart II went mostly unseen for a month or two. A prisoner of time in a dimension of sorrow and confusion, Moothart was hitting a personal crossroads and nursing a brief and impermanent break up with his long time girlfriend/band mate by retreating, putting the pain from his head into his tape machine, stepping away from struggling for the answers in order to sit with them and pull from them. Greasing the pain to form relief. The only medicine was to challenge himself and sand down enough to break through the fear of failure. To see it all through to the end and find out what stood as truth.\n\nNow, after the fog has lifted, upon returning, Moothart is sharing the souvenir of his travels to another dimension, a postcard from a dream in which time stood still, the girl got away and the wolf-man-glass-in-hand risked it all for the sea change.\n\n“Still Life” is unlike any other record Moothart has recorded; the songs came quickly, were recorded as experiments and he went through the process alone. Previously Moothart’s bands have been collaborations from all sides, from his high school hardcore punk quartet Culture Kids with CFM band mate Michael Anderson to the toughest pop band in Southern California, Moonhearts, to the fleeting garage rock band the Perverts with long time friend and collaborator Ty Segall. The monolithic super group Fuzz was the product of Charles’ master riffs marrying Segall’s songwriting prowess and unparalleled rhythmic style. A perfect meetingof minds of two musicians in their prime. Two friends with egos so intertwined in the midst of a five year touring spell in Segall’s band as his secret weapon, heard but not seen, hidden in tangles, the two became a tangled force themselves.\n\nSometimes you realize you must shed what’s most comfortable to find truth in yourself again and so Moothart has denied the comforts of being the sideman to give listeners a slice of himself. Moothart has recruited high school friend Michael Anderson to play guitar, lone-wolf-jack-of-all-trades Tyler Frome on bass and Audacity’s powerhouse drummer Thomas Alvarez to round out the rhythm section of this outsider band.",

  "artistSummary": "Between the vast expanses and disparate extremes of space lies “The High Frontier:” a term coined by Gerard K O’Neil in his illustrated 1976 book depicting human colonization of space. In their new thusly titled LP, Lumerians send terrified primates into space in search of wonders both marvelous and harrowing. In a starship powered by gamma-ray-mutated rock, beer-goggled cartographers chart the absurd scales of outer space from subatomic to trans-galactic and the unfathomable void of inner space unbound by physical laws. Inward perception, both fluid and delicate, births, destroys, multiplies and collides temporal realities. Hacking through gnarled carnivorous plants with pyrokinetic machetes, Lumerians thrust forward with Krautrock inspired exploration, Afrobeat’s ritualistic rhythms, post-punk guitar noise and cracked-glacé synth lines culled from perverse 1970’s sci-fi soundtracks. As a followup to 2011’s “Transmalinnia,” “The High Frontier” sets scope outward, points blind-folded at a star map and sets off full blast without making course corrections.\n\nSince forming in 2006, Oakland’s Lumerians have gained notoriety for their intense performances, stunning live visuals and thematic otherworldly releases. Recording from their self-built studio/brewery in a converted store-front church, Lumerians acknowledge the role sound and rhythm have always played in transcendent and ecstatic rituals the world over, from the repetitious drums of tribal animists to the penetrating electronic pulses of neon dance clubs.",

  "artistSummary": "Few bands have the ability to evoke an old-school throwback vibe and yet sound entirely fresh and new at the same time. Royal Jelly is one of those bands. Combining elements of Soul, Rock, Swing and Hip-Hop, Royal Jelly shakes up any dance-party and grooves harder than your typical rock n' roll band dares to go. Fronted by the enigmatic singer Lauren Bjelde, who brings a one-of-a-kind sultry voice to her magnetic stage presence, Royal Jelly leans on the sounds of swingin' horns, gritty keys and a bumpin' rhythm section to carry a crowd into bliss... creating an unforgettable live experience that will leave you wanting more. \nBattlehooch\nBattlehooch is the kind of band you thought went extinct with landline phones & cassette tapes. In one sense they’re a band from another, sturdier era: a band that releases consistently quality material on a consistent basis, a band that doesn’t sacrifice creative drive for commercial interest, a band that grows and evolves with each successive release. From the beautiful madcap mess of debut LP Piecechow to the more refined yet still quite zany jams on Hot Lungs to a cool, polished psych-rock sheen on 2014’s Wink EP, Battlehooch has proven itself as a band built to last. They may possess an old-school mindset, but their music is weird & diverse enough to fit into this wild new century.\n\nFormed in San Francisco, the birthplace of psychedelia, it’s fitting that the six-piece collective echoes the city’s tie-dyed past in its own compositions. However, the group isn’t content with becoming a mere tribute to a time period they never lived through. Instead, Battlehooch updates the sound of psychedelia for a new generation, one that can now access dozens of genres & millions of songs with a few clicks on their iPhones. Battlehooch reflects this modern trend of manic music consumption: on any of their many releases, the listener will be treated to a sonic smorgasbord, bouncing from hard rock to dance-pop to cartoony head trips to flirtations with electronica & jazz & Afrobeat & everything else in between within the span of a few minutes, sometimes even seconds. \nLoco Tranquilo\nLoco Tranquilo is a San Francisco-based ensemble whose music features swirling, percussive jazz and international folk influences.",

  "artistSummary": "Pegi Young & The Survivors\nPegi Young’s powerful new album, Raw, gets right to the point. Opening cut “Why” kicks off with Young’s impassioned alto, demanding, “Why’d you have to ruin my life? Why’d you have to be so mean?” Over the soulful Americana rock of her band the Survivors – led by legendary keyboardist/songwriter Spooner Old- ham – Young taps into a surprisingly primal force.\n\nThere’s a reason for that. Young wrote most of Raw in the wake of her 2014 sepa- ration and divorce from Neil Young, to whom she’d been married thirty-six years. Over the decades, the pair had raised a family, made music together, and worked to support northern California’s Bridge School for severely disabled children. Pegi founded the Bridge School in 1986 after being unable to find the right kind of care for their son, Ben, who has cerebral palsy.\n\n“[Raw] was very cathartic for me,” Young says. “What happened was real, but I also look at this record as having a universal quality to it. I’m certainly not the only one to go through a late-in-life divorce, and I’m not going to be the last. But in my case, it was so painful because we’d shared so many years building a life, together, weathering its ups and downs.\n\nYet the songs – most co-written with guitarist Kelvin Holly and Oldham – aren’t all expressions of anger. The first track to be released from the album is “Too Lit- tle Too Late,” a raw and poetic psalm of regret, the truth-tellin’ “Gave My Best to You” and a rockin’ update on “These Boots are Made for Walkin’” convey resili- ence and sass. A gorgeous, stripped-down version of Don Henley’s “The Heart of the Matter” explores the grace of forgiveness. As a whole, the album is a journey from shock, to rage, to sadness, to strength, but not necessarily in that order.\n\nYoung sees Raw as the soundtrack to the seven stages of grief. “It’s not a linear process,” she says. “You bounce back and forth. And each song could be sung by either party.”\n\nIn addition to chronicling this new chapter of her life, Raw also reflects the music Young has been drawn to since growing up in northern California in the 1960s. “Yes, I remember dancing in the living room to Motown,” she says. “I’ve always loved harmonies, lyrics, and rhythm. I used to go to the Fillmore and the Avalon and Winterland.”\n\nAlthough it would be decades before she would take her work to the stage, Young was writing poetry in grade school and studying it in college. She picked up an acoustic and taught herself some chords and folk covers, and became a bona fide hippie nomad: hitchhiking around the country, with stops in Vermont and Cana- da. By 1972, she’d settled down with her dog in a teepee in northern California. “I bought it for $200,” she says. “My first home.” In 1974, she was working in a res- taurant and living in the teepee when she met Neil Young.\n\nThe rock & roll road, family life, tending to the Young children, and the creation and operation of the Bridge School kept her busy. But by the early ‘aughts, Young, having toured with her ex-husband and spent time in the studio with the best of the best, was ready to become a recording artist in her own right, encouraged by Neil’s longtime manager Elliot Roberts. Two songs written during “the teepee years” ultimately graced her eponymous 2007 debut album. “I mostly set out to do covers,” Young says of that collection. “I was really shy about breaking out my own songs, but about three days into it, my guitarist original lead guitarist, An- thony Crawford convinced me to bring in my stuff.” The country-rock-tinged al- bum also marked her first recorded work with Spooner Oldham and the late pe- dal steel icon Ben Keith, both of whom she’d sang alongside on Neil’s tours. They formed the original core of Pegi Young and the Survivors.\n\nRaw features Oldham and several more recent Survivors, including Muscle Shoals-based guitarist Kelvin Holly, a veteran of Little Richard’s band; drummer Phil Jones; and the newest “Survivor” Shonna Tucker (Drive-By Truckers), who’ve added soulful muscle to the sonic texture. The group lost their original Bassist the renown Rick Rosas in 2014.\n\n“With Kelvin in the band, we’re going to a place in my wheelhouse, more R & B stuff, like Otis Clay’s ‘Trying to Live My Life Without You,’ which also has the great horn sounds [from the TexiCali Horns] and harmonies of the girl groups I listened to as a kid.”\n\nOf her five albums, Raw is the first on which Young is credited with production duties. Her M.O: “Be authentic, be true, sing what’s in your heart. It’s not about making it perfect, it’s about letting it be real, sometimes raw and flawed, as long as it’s true.” This also includes highlighting her band, the Survivors, whose cama- raderie she credits with strengthening and inspiring her. That is most evident on unabashed rocker “You Won’t Take My Laugh Away From Me,” a defiant strut of hard-won confidence that ends with Young’s joyful laughter.\n\n“My laugh has always been rather distinctive,” Young says. “It’s something I can hold on to that’s still mine.” As for the future, Young has started work on a mem- oir and making plans for a tour around Raw’s release. “I am a survivor,” she re- lates. “Although we named the band The Survivors after Ben Keith died, We didn’t have any idea some ten years ago, what an apt name it would turn out to be! I’ve gone through a lot of good stuff and scary stuff, and I will keep going for-ward.”",

  "cost": 15,
  "artistSummary": "Cosmonauts came into being in 2009 in outer space or Orange County, depending on the way you like to look at things. The band was originally formed by Derek Cowart and Alexander Ahmadi after he heard Cowart play a Spaceman3 song solo at a show in their home town of Fullerton, CA. The two were students at different high schools but as it turned out, of the same musical school of thought: two lovers of lo-fi, adorers of the atmospheric, kindred pop-loving spirits. The two bonded over the Velvet Underground and Brian Jonestown Massacre, and quickly turned their mutual appreciation club into a band. Cosmonauts have been making music ever since, picking up bassist James Sanderson and a host of different drummers along the way (the spot is currently filled by Mark Morones). Now residing in Los Angeles, they’ve put out a number of releases (including three full length albums) through Burger Records and various other labels.\n\nThey’ve toured extensively through the US and Europe, and played alongside Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Pixies, Slowdive, Black Lips, Belle & Sebastian, and more, though Cosmonauts don’t exactly fit neatly into the fabric of their scene: too psychedelic to be punk, too punk to be psychedelic, and too absorbed in making their own brand of music to care.\n\nTheir latest offering, A-OK!, is out August 19th via Burger Records. \nThe Molochs\nFirst, let’s meet Moloch. You remember him, right? The ancient god, the child eater, the demander of sacrifice, the villain in Ginsberg’s Howl(and also real life) and now the personal antagonist of singer and songwriter Lucas Fitzsimons, who named his band the Molochs because he knew he’d have to make sacrifices to get what he needed, and because he always wanted a reminder of the Ginsbergian monster he’d be fighting against. And so this is how you make a record right now: you fight for every piece, and when Moloch takes apart your relationships and career potential and leaves you sleeping on couches or living in terrifying apartments and just about depleted from awful people involving you in their awful decisions, you grab a bottle of wine (and laugh at the cliché) and put together another song. And once you do that eleven hard-won times in total, you get a record like America’s Velvet Glory: honest, urgent, desperate and fearless because of it.\n\nFitzsimons came to his calling in an appropriately mythic way, born in a historic city not far from Buenos Aires and raised in L.A.’s South Bay—just outside of Inglewood—where he was immersed in the hip-hop hits on local radio. (Westside Connection!) The summer d before he started middle school, a close friend got an electric guitar, and Fitzsimons felt an enirresistible inexplicable power: “I'd go back home and I’d look up guitar chords on the internet—even though I had no guitar—and just imagine how I WOULD play them. I was slowly getting obsessed.” When he was 12, his parents took him back to Argentina, and on the first night, he discovered a long-forgotten almost-broken classical guitar in the basement of his ancestral home: “It sounds made-up, but it’s true,” he says. “I didn't put the guitar down once that whole trip—took it with me everywhere and played and played. When I got back to L.A., I bought my first guitar practically as the plane was landing.”\n\nThis started a long line of bands and a long experience of learning to perform in public, as Fitzsimons honed intentions and ideas and tried to figure out why that guitar seemed so important. After a trip to India in 2012, he returned renewed and ready to start again, scrapping his band to lead something new and uncompromising. This was the true start of the Molochs: “It didn't make any sense to not do everything exactly the way I wanted to do it,” he says. “I was so shy and introverted that singing publicly sounded like a nightmare come true. But I didn't have a choice—I heard something inside of me and I needed to be the one to express it.”\n\nThe first album Forgetter Blues was released with Fitzsimons’ guitarist/organist and longtime bandmate Ryan Foster in early 2013 on his own label—named after a slightly infamous intersection in their then-home of Long Beach—and was twelve songs of anxious garage-y proto-punk-y folk-y rock, Modern Lovers demos and Velvet Underground arcana as fuel and foundation both. It deserved to go farther than it did, which sadly wasn’t very far. But it sharpened Fitzsimons and his songwriting, and after three pent-up years of creativity, he was ready to burst. So he decided to record a new album in the spirit of the first, and in the spirit of everything that the Molochs made so far: “I wanted to spend less time figuring out HOW we were gonna do something and just actually do it.”\n\nThe result is America’s Velvet Glory, recorded with engineer Jonny Bell at effortless (says Fitzsimons) sessions at Long Beach’s JazzCats studio. (Also incubator for Molochs’ new labelmates Wall of Death and Hanni El Khatib.) It starts with an anxious electric minor-key melody and ends on a last lonesome unresolved organ riff, and in between comes beauty, doubt, loss, hate and even a moments or two of peace. There are flashes of 60s garage rock—like the Sunset Strip ’66 stormer “No More Cryin’” or the “Little Black Egg”-style heartwarmer-slash-breaker “The One I Love”—but like one of Foster’s and Fitzsimons’ favorites the Jacobites, the Molochs are taking the past apart, not trying to recreate it.\n\nYou can hear where songs bend, where voices break, where guitars start to shiver and when strings are about to snap; on “You And Me,” you can almost hear Lou Reed’s ghost call for a solo, and on “I Don’t Love You,” you get that subway-sound guitar and find out what happens when Jonathan Richman’s G-I-R-L-F-R-E-N goes wrong. And of course there’s the charismatic chaos of bootleg basement-tape Dylan—always Dylan, says Fitzsimons—and the locked-room psychedelia of Syd Barrett, especially on “Charlie’s Lips,” Fitzsimons’ ode to—or antidote to—those times when he felt the bleakness completely: “Then a bird lands on a branch nearby, you hear leaves fluttering, you hear a child laughing … all of a sudden things don't seem so bad anymore.”\n\nSo Moloch might still be out there, devouring his sacrifices, but the Molochs are still fighting, too. And that’s why Fitzsimons picked the band name—it’s so he remembers what he’s up against. He’s not celebrating the destroyer of youth and individuality and creativity, he says: “I’m just keeping him in sight so that he doesn't win.” – Christopher Ziegler \nMax Gardener\nMax Gardener makes his self-described “bedroom theme music” amidst the solitude of his California bedroom, and he intends for you to hear it in the solitude of yours.\n\nOn debut record Memory Lounge [Sports Day Records and Citrus City Records], Gardener drifts forth, mixing the sunny trademarks of sixties psych and nostalgia-inducing guitar pop hooks with his omnipresent optimism and a healthy dose of melancholy.\n\n“I was in a weird place,” he says of the recording process, conducted entirely in the privacy of his Long Beach home. “I’d be stuck in my room, recording for a whole day, just drinking coffee and kind of going crazy.”\n\nThe result is a series of kaleidoscopic songs about times past and the days ahead. Memory Lounge contains sparkling multitudes: songs for the beachside happy endings of a teen movie, long nights spent dreaming alone, or endless summer evenings with friends. A lilting guitar bounces along the radiant “Space for the Memories.” On “He Still Loves Her,” Gardener spins bittersweet longing into a shimmering melody reminiscent of The Kinks, The Shins, and The Radio Dept.",

Once and Future Band: this incredibly accomplished cabal of total prog wizards has circled the earth, but then, these are the accomplished gentlemen of many former pursuits (the formidable Drunk Horse among them) and all of them comets themselves. The very mid 70s vibe at work here surpasses pastiche, and crests that lovely anachronistic conceptual peak: a fully realized and meticulously arranged psych record, meant to be listened to from top to bottom, with the lights down low and in a comfy chair perhaps, or while gazing out the window of your life pod. A Dark Side of the Moon feel, with shades of early Yes’s technicality, a dash of Steely Dan’s vocal prowess and effortless sheen, and some seriously outsized hooks that call to mind the mighty ELO, Le Orme and yes, even the unsinkable Queen powered on Brian May’s tape echo jet fuel and sequined power cells…this is a head record in the classic sense but we swear to The Dark One that you will be trapped and infected by the pop-parasite. That it is largely self-produced (with tracking/engineering on three of the songs by Phil Manley at El Studio) makes it all the more jaw dropping. We didn’t realize how much we needed Once and Future Band in our life, but now that they’re here we can’t get them out of our brains or off of our stereo. Making prog cool again, again, and then slightly more complicatedly, again.",

  "artistSummary": "Howie Day’s emotionally resonant lyrics and inventive melodies have earned him both critical praise and a legion of devoted fans. He is known for his energetic, heartfelt shows, where he connects with audiences through the strength of his songwriting and his quirky sense of humor. Day’s warm tenor voice “soars into fluttering, high registers, but also grates with real, pleading grit,” as one critic put it. After sales of over a million records and two Top 10 hits, Day is back on the road in support of his new studio album, Lanterns.\n\nA native of Bangor, Maine, Day began playing piano at age five and guitar at age 12. By 15, he was writing his own songs and performing across New England. Shortly after graduating high school, Day became a fixture at college coffeehouses across the U.S. He wrote, financed and released his first effort, Australia, which was named Best Debut Album at the 2001 Boston Music Awards. The Boston Globe called Day “gorgeously seasoned, far beyond his years” with “a brave, beautiful singing voice.” During his relentless touring schedule, Day began experimenting with effects pedals and loop-sampling techniques as he performed, layering live percussion with vocal harmonies and guitar parts to become a veritable one-man band. He went on to sell over 30,000 copies of Australia as he navigated the independent music scene and continued to hone his craft.\n\nAfter signing with Epic Records, Day released his major-label debut, Stop All The World Now, and hit the road to support it. The constant promotion paid off: Stop was certified gold in the U.S. and spawned two Top 10 radio hits: “She Says” and the platinum single “Collide.” After three subsequent years of intense worldwide touring, Day moved to Los Angeles and returned to the studio. His next release, Sound the Alarm, built on the emotionally complex spirit of its predecessor and delved into Day’s journey from indie wunderkind to platinum-selling artist. Its lead single, “Be There,” became a staple at modern AC radio.\n\nAfter parting ways with Epic and relocating to New York City in 2010, Day released the Ceasefire EP on his own label, Daze. Over the next two years, as a reenergized Day toured North America, Australia and Asia, new songs began to emerge and evolve. His fourth full-length album, Lanterns, was recorded in Boston with producer and longtime friend Mike Denneen. Awash with a warm musicality and unique instrumentation, the album also features guest vocals from Aimee Mann. Lanterns was released in April 2015.",

They even became popular overseas.\n\nThen Ezra went solo. He holed up in the attic (in Chicago where he is from) and made The Year of No Returning, released in 2012. Ezra’s follow-up album, entitled Day of the Dog, will be released in September of 2013 on Bar/None Records. Right now he is one of the best songwriters around. He rocks, he connects, he haunts and he kills. These days he usually plays with his wild band, The Boy-Friends. He's one of our finest Rock ‘n’ Roll fools, heart open wide and fangs bared. Keep your eyes peeled, ladies and gents. He's far from finished.",

  "artistSummary": "Tara Jane ONeil is a multi-instrumentalist, composer, and visual artist. She creates melodic and experimental music under her own name and in collaboration with her brilliant friends. Her recordings and live performances range from solo songing to noise improvisations. TJO has composed and performed music and sound for films, theater and dance performances, and written large and small ensemble experimental architectures.\n\nAs a solo artist, TJO has released 7 albums internationally. She was a founding member of Rodan and several other bands, and has collaborated on recordings and stages with musical artists such as the groups Ida, Mirah, Jackie O MF, Lucky Dragons, Mount Eerie, LIttle Wings, Papa M, Come, and Michael Hurley, Catherine Irwin, Marisa Anderson, Amy Ray, Nikaido Kazumi, Ben Vida and many more. In addition to rock clubs, galleries and DIY spaces all around north America, Europe, and Japan, she has performed at All Tomorrow’s Parties, the Centre de Pompidou, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the New Musuem, TBA festival, High Desert Test Sites and many many others. She has shown her visual art in galleries all over the northern hemisphere and had three monographs of her visual art published. Her new self-titled album will be released by Gnomonsong records in April 2017. \nCalifone\nAfter the disintegration of Chicago’s blues-rock innovators Red Red Meat, the band’s four remaining members struck out on their own, initiating several varied endeavors but never straying too far from their home base, or each other. Ben Massarella and Tim Rutili revived their Perishable Records imprint, Brian Deck opened the Clava recording studios, adjacent to the Perishable offices, and Tim Hurley recorded and released his own Sin Ropas project on the resurrected label. While enduring the fluctuation between crisis and monotony inherent in the daily operation of a small, independent record label, Rutili began work on his next musical project, Califone.\n\nNamed after the pedant audio supply manufacturer, Califone was initially just Rutili banging out songs with a computer. Eventually, he began to enlist the help of some familiar cohorts and cycled through several transient contributors; ultimately, the revolving cast spawned 1998’s self-titled debut EP. A joint Flydaddy/Perishable release, the record was distinctly more focused and confident than Red Red Meat’s swan song, There’s a Star Above the Manger Tonight. While still incorporating the bizarre sounds and sequenced beats of that record, this time the band didn’t allow its in-studio experimentation to overwhelm the songs.\n\nInterestingly, at the end of the nascent recording sessions for Califone, someone in Rutili’s new conglomerate noticed that the band was, in effect, a reincarnation of Red Red Meat; the principal members of the supposedly defunct quartet were the only remaining people in the studio. A second self-titled EP followed in 2000 on Portland’s Road Cone label, which soon after was paired with the first on the Sometimes Good Weather Follows Bad People compilation.\n\nWith Califone’s fundamental studio lineup at least temporarily solidified as Massarella, Rutili, and Deck, the band recorded its debut LP, Roomsound, with an open-door policy; members of Eleventh Dream Day, Tortoise, and Fruit Bats all performed on the album. Released in the spring of 2001, Roomsound fused the disparate elements the band had been struggling to unite since There’s a Star Above the Manger Tonight, creating a cohesive, affecting album. The limited-edition Deceleration One appeared in February 2002, showcasing some of Califone’s stunning live-recorded instrumentals. It was a combination of film loop mixing by Jeff Economy and Carolyn Faber and a puppetry sketch interpreted by Califone.\n\nA month later, Sometimes Good Weather Follows Bad People was released, capturing the two new tracks as well as material from the band’s two previously out of print EPs initially available on Flydaddy and Road Cone. Rutili and Massarella were on a roll. They collected additional musicians during the summer of 2002 for the recording of the Quicksand/Cradlesnakes EP. It’s a rough-edged, dark effort, but Califone’s ever-changing musical cinema remained at its best. Released in 2004, Heron King Blues further refined their blending of melodic acoustic compositions and experimental tendencies before the band went on hiatus for most of 2005 while Rutili focused on soundtrack work. The band reconvened in late 2005 to begin work on Roots & Crowns, released in October 2006. All My Friends Are Funeral Singers followed in 2009. Bluesy, broken, and impressionistic, 2013’s Southwest-birthed Stitches was the first Califone release to be recorded entirely outside of the Windy City. ~ Bryan Carroll",

  "artistSummary": "The Mattson 2\nIf you could soundtrack the jangle of the sea and the jazz of the surf, The Mattson 2 would most certainly be the composers. The identical twin guitar and drums duo are truly a marvel of jazz-rock orchestration and arrangement. The duo shimmers and shakes with the soaring modern wizardry of Jared Mattson's untamed, layered guitars and Jonathan Mattson's tribal jazz hard- bop drumming. They channel the gorgeously hypnotic gods of surf, sun, and neon-punk-jazz of our modern universe, evoking evolved realms of experimentalism, rhythm, and story. The identical twin’s deep telepathic kinship navigates colorful forms of beautiful weirdness and exotic landscapes of layered improvisation, transcending the concept of modern musical performance. They have toured relentlessly throughout Japan, Brazil, Paris, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Finland, The Netherlands, and the United States. The Mattson 2 have Bachelor’s degrees in Jazz and The African Diaspora from University of California San Diego, and Masters of Fine Arts degrees in Integrated Composition, Improvisation, and Technology from University of California Irvine. Mattson 2 have collaborated with Thomas Campbell, Ray Barbee, Tommy Guerrero, Cornelius, Chocolat & Akito Katayose, Money Mark, Nicole Mitchell, Mark Dresser, Farmer Dave Scher, John Herndon, and John McEntire. \nMoney Mark\nMusician, producer, and mad scientist of music, Mark \"Money Mark\" (and sometimes just \"Money\", or, \"$$\") Ramos Nishita is a music industry veteran well known for his collaborations with the The Beastie Boys, The Talking Heads' David Byrne, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs- among many others. Born in Detroit, Mark moved to LA around the age of 11. He studied acting in school and picked up carpentry through building sets for plays. $ supported himself by building cabinets from scratch until he was able to launch his music career from his DIY home-studio in Gardena, CA. Mark- who is now a seasoned world traveler -drove from LA to NYC and back when he was just 16 with some friends, and has stories from around the globe you wouldn't believe are true! He's also known for his signature 3-point turn-around fade-away. \nDJ Jordan Blackmon (Toro Y Moi)\nHailing from South Carolina, Jordan Blackmon (guitarist for Toro y Moi ) brings a vibey set of all-vinyl from the back half of the 20th century. Soul, funk, garage, and psych deep cuts primarily collected while globetrotting.",

  "artistSummary": "Whereas The Game Of Monogamy was an orchestral album filled with theatrical arrangements, Adult Film favors less ornate, equally impactful instrumentation across its 10 affecting tracks. The album is filled with variations of Kasher's signature blend of ruminative rock/pop, ranging from raucous and barreling (\"American Lit,\" \"Truly Freaking Out\") to uneasy and undulating (\"Where's Your Heart Lie,\" the dreamy \"Lay Down Your Weapons\"), from deceptively bright and poppy (\"The Willing Cuckold,\" \"A Raincloud is a Raincloud\") to tempered and cascading (\"You Scare Me To Death,\" \"A Lullaby, sort of\"). Lyrically, Kasher is at his incisive best, thematically elastic and touching on aging (self-reflection and taking stock), mortality (one's own and others'), and relationships of all kinds. Kasher is joined on Adult Film by Sara Bertuldo (bass, vocals), Patrick Newbery (organ, keys, synths, horns), and Dylan Ryan (drums) – who backed him while touring around The Game Of Monogamy – as well as additional artists including Nate Kinsella (drums; of Make Believe and Birthmark) and Laura Stevenson (vocals; of Laura Stevenson and the Cans), among others. The album was mixed by John Congleton (St. Vincent, Wye Oak, Explosions In The Sky) at Elmwood Recording in Dallas, TX. \nAllison WeissCall it cliche but sometimes a musician's inspiration can be broken down simply. Some are inspired by fame and money and some just want to tell their story to everyone. The latter is the best way to describe 25-year-old singer-songwriter Allison Weiss. \"When I started playing, I wasn't so much inspired by other musicians as I was inspired by the need to get a feeling out into the world,\" she states. Weiss' honest, catchy, folk-infused powerpop have attracted a devoted fanbase over the last few years. While her music has changed stylistically, her passion to create music hasn't. \"I've always been a writer. I've got a lot to say to people and the only way I know how to do it is through pop songs.\"Weiss first picked up the guitar at the age of 14. Inspired by pop punk and the ups-and-downs of young relationships, her journey began. Throughout it all, Weiss always embraced a DIY ethic. \"I've always been a shameless self promoter. I never counted on finding anyone who believed in me as much as I did, so I just learned to handle everything myself\" she says.Confidence in herself mixed with natural online marketing skills has helped Weiss' spread her music to new audiences. Two highly successful Kickstarter campaigns resulted in New York Times and Wired Magazine features and a panelist position at SXSW.It was at this point, Weiss made one of the biggest decisions of her life and moved to Brooklyn. The change of scenery brought a whole new mindset when it came to making music. \"In the past I was just a sad teenager in my bedroom writing hopeless breakup songs. I'm still a sad teenager on the inside, but I'm also a pretty happy adult trying to figure myself out and talk about love in a more mature way,\" Weiss reflects. Weiss' maturity shined on the self-released I Was An Island EP.Earlier this year, Weiss received one of the biggest honors of her young career. She was handpicked by Lou Reed to join his backup band for a European tour. While some might be intimidated by the presence of a rock legend, she tried to absorb as much as possible from the experience. \"Our soundchecks were two hours long and he'd be there the whole time, breaking a song down into the tiniest parts, perfecting the sound.\" Weiss remembers. \"He has this way of breaking you down with brutal honesty and building you back up with the most genuine praise. One minute he looks you in the eye and says your note was terrible. The next minute he stops the song to tell you how beautiful you just sounded.\"If she took anything from Mr. Reed however, it was the reminder to always have fun and enjoy the ride. The sky is the limit at this point for Ms. Weiss. \"My favorite moment is right now. I feel like I've just made the record I've been dying to make. I started playing electric guitar again. I got my hands on a tour van. I played in Europe with a legend. I flew over the Atlantic four times this summer. I've got this constant feeling that something great is about to happen.\"",

  "artistSummary": "FUTUREBIRDSBaba Yaga, the second full-length album by Athens, GA’s , marks a milestone in the continuous evolution of the eclectic ensemble. The 13-song album finds Futurebirds – Thomas Johnson, Carter King, Dennis Love, Brannen Miles, Daniel Womack, and Payton Bradford (who has since left the lineup to pursue a non-musical career path) – delivering an expansive yet intimate set that takes the band’s trademark mix of earthily accessible songcraft and free-spirited experimentation into inspired new territory. Like the band that made it, Baba Yaga defies easy categorization, boasting a beguiling blend of warmly catchy tunes, stirringly evocative lyrics, distinctive sonic textures and unexpected melodic twists. The music is both intense and uplifting, capturing a good deal of the soaring, primal, sweat-soaked spirit of Futurebirds’ live shows, which have already won the group a rabidly devoted fan base and a reputation as a singularly inspired, bravely unpredictable performing unit. Throughout Baba Yaga, Futurebirds’ inventiveness and energy are suffused by a bittersweet, introspective melancholy that lends added emotional resonance to such compelling tunes as “Virginia Slims,” “Serial Bowls,” “Death Awaits” and “St. Summercamp,” which showcase the band’s indelible melodies, vivid lyrics and vibrant instrumental rapport. “This album definitely feels like a big milestone for us, no question,” King says. “Just the fact that it’s finally coming out feels like a milestone in itself,” adds Johnson. Indeed, Baba Yaga’s long journey to the public’s ears is a story in itself, but the music more than justifies the album’s long and often frustrating birth cycle. Early in their existence, Futurebirds’ balance of homespun roots and forward-thinking exploration made the band a favorite in and around their bohemian hometown. The 2009 release of their self-titled debut EP was followed the next year by their first full-length debut album, Hampton’s Lullaby. It was followed by the self-released EP Via Flamina, and the limited-edition 2011 Record Store Day release Live at Seney-Stovall Chapel, which sold out on the day of its release. Futurebirds continued to build its fan base by touring relentlessly, sharing bills with the likes of Drive-By Truckers, Widespread Panic, Heartless Bastards and Alabama Shakes and performing at such prestigious festivals as Austin City Limits, Outside Lands, Hangout, Wakarusa, Forecastle and Bonnaroo. Futurebirds was also featured on 2011’s Bonnaroo Buzz tour, playing between Gary Clark Jr. and headliner Grace Potter & The Nocturnals. Futurebirds’ combustible musical chemistry reaches inspired new heights on Baba Yaga. “In some ways we’re like one organism with six brains, but at the same time everyone in the band is vastly different,” King observes. “We had five different songwriters in the band on this record, with very different influences and inspirations. We get into the studio and people bring in their songs, and by the time we get done with a song, there’s a piece of everybody in it.” “We all come from different backgrounds and chase different sounds, but when we play together there’s this weird dark chemistry amongst us,” Johnson notes, adding, “I can hear a song that someone else wrote and know exactly what I can bring to it, and the same goes for the others when they hear my songs.” Baba Yaga was recorded in 45 studio days over the course of seven months, with the band touring between sessions in order to pay the recording bills. The musicians originally demoed about 30 songs for the project, 25 of which they recorded during the sessions, before paring that batch down to the 13 that appear on the finished album “The songs on this album seem to all come from a similar place,” adds Johnson. “They don’t all sound the same or have the same vibe, but we’ve shared so many experiences that there’s an unspoken understanding amongst us as to where a song is coming from and where it wants to go.” The bumpy road to the album’s release – which resulted in a near two-year gap between Futurebirds releases—included making difficult decisions in finding the proper home for the album, but helped to inspire the band to name it Baba Yaga, after a forest-dwelling, child-eating witch from Slavic folklore. “It was a long and painstaking process trying to get this album out,” King explains. “We got pretty discouraged, feeling like maybe it would never see the light of day, and one day I was talking to Thomas and started saying, ‘God, is this record some mythical creature out in the woods that only exists in our imaginations?’ Then we read about Baba Yaga, and that perfectly described how we were feeling about this record.” Fortunately, Futurebirds has emerged from its business travails a more confident and determined creative unit – a fact that the band plans on demonstrating by touring as much as humanly possible. “The songs can take different lives from night to night,” King says, “because you feed off the energy of the crowd, and that energy can be really different from night to night. The most important thing is to keep things fresh and not be up there going through the motions.” “Musically, we’re a lot sharper now than we’ve ever been, and that’s a product of playing so many shows,” Johnson concludes. “Going into the recording of the record, we were much better musicians, songwriters and collaborators than we’d ever been, and we feel like the end result reflects our maturity and development.” With Baba Yaga finally a musical reality rather than an elusive myth, Futurebirds are more than ready to show the world how they’ve grown.",

  "artistSummary": "You can tell how much Lewis Watson has changed by his hair. Gone is the heavy, forward-swept fringe that was his trademark in his teens, when he was signed on the strength of a single, self-released EP and wrote much of his acclaimed debut album, 2014’s The Morning. In its place are long locks he recently dyed from dark to white – not to shock, but in part to signal a new start.\n\n“I’ve always wanted white hair,” says Lewis. “So I thought, why not? I’m finally in a position to make my own decisions, and not just about my music. The biggest change I’ve made is taking control of my career. Everything I do, everything you see comes from me.”\n\nMidnight, the Oxford singer’s sensational second album, is testament to that change. Written and recorded entirely under his own stream, with friends as collaborators it’s a sonic leap on from his largely acoustic debut – bigger, bolder, beautifully textured and more experimental, but still as brutally honest and achingly intimate as his bewitching early EPs.\n\n“It’s an evolution from my first album,” says Lewis. “It’s grander, heavier and more electronic. I still like acoustic music – and there are some quieter songs on there – but I also love Death Cab For Cutie, Bombay Bicycle Club and Bon Iver. It is a big change, but it’s still me. Maybe me with added spice.”\n\nRecorded in just three weeks last summer at The Vale in Warwickshire and produced by Lewis’ close friend Anthony West of Oh Wonder, Midnight was made without any label involvement. In fact, it wasn’t until Zane Lowe premiered gritty, drums-driven first single ‘Maybe We’re Home’ on his radio show in January that anyone outside Lewis’ circle had heard his new material.\n\n“It was crucial for me that these songs sounded exactly as I imagined them,” says Lewis. “I didn’t want any outside input. In the past, I’ve been forced to write with people I didn’t know and work with producers I had nothing in common with. I’m still incredibly proud of The Morning. It will always be special because it’s my debut, but it was a bit of a Frankenstein. The songs were recorded with a half a dozen producers in six or seven studios over the course of two years. We made Midnight in a bubble, so it’s much more coherent. Every track has my stamp on every aspect. It’s a snapshot of where and who I am right now.”\n\nAs soon as ‘Maybe We’re Home’ hit the airwaves, labels came calling. Having left his deal with Warners after their delay in releasing his debut, Lewis was cautious, but when Cooking Vinyl, on both sides of the Atlantic, made an offer, he accepted. \n\n“The musician City & Colour, who is on their roster, is the reason I took up music,” says Lewis. “He was and still is a big influence. He’s a career musician with a huge cult following who makes his own decisions. My aim is to sing for a living for the rest of my life, so the deal had to be right. And so far, it’s gone like a dream.”\n\nKey to Midnight is the stately, stirring, Snow Patrol-esque ‘Deep The Water’, the first song Lewis wrote for the album after a self-imposed six months away from making music in 2015. “I was still playing shows,” says Lewis. “We toured the States and Australia and played a fantastic festival in the Philippines, but for a full six months, I stopped writing songs. I’d grown to dislike the process, which was heart breaking for me because I’ve loved songwriting since I picked up a guitar aged 16. But I needed a break, to be reinvigorated, to learn to love it all over again. I took a step back for as long as possible to see what would change.”\n\nThat summer, Lewis found out. He got together with Anthony West and Josephine Vander Gucht just to jam and discuss ideas, but straight away songs started to flow. The first was ‘Deep The Water’ but in a matter of days, they had completed five songs, among them the album’s sweet, spine-tingling, strings-soaked highlight ‘Hello Hello’ and the epic ‘Little Light’ an emotionally-exposed love letter to Lewis’ girlfriend of five years. \n\n“I’m loathe to use the word magical, but it really was,” laughs Lewis. “It was a joyous, organic experience. ‘Deep The Water’ came flooding out of me on the first day and lifted this immense weight from my shoulders. I’d worried I might not be able to write, but I couldn’t stop. For the first time, there was no one shoving words in my direction or making suggestions.”\n\n‘Deep The Water’ is one of several songs on Midnight about a relationship gone wrong, but it’s also about survival.“It’s about giving the most and receiving the least,” explains Lewis. “It’s based on an experience I’ve had of loving someone who expects you to come running when they need you, but gives nothing back. But like most of my songs, it’s a sentiment that can apply to different situations. It’s about being used, whether that’s at work or by a friend or a lover, the emotion is the same.”\n\nThe two oldest tracks on the album are the dreamy ‘LA Song’ and the rootsy, Springsteen-referencing ‘When The Water Meets The Mountains’, both originally intended for Lewis’ debut, but since reinvented. \n\n“The deluxe version of The Morning included a demo of ‘LA Song’, so you can hear how much it’s evolved,” says Lewis. “It’s now built from bass chords with floaty electric guitar on top. The whole album is rich in textures and atmosphere. ‘Give Me Life’, for example, has 28 guitar parts, but a lot of those are just layers and textures. I’ve discovered that songs aren’t simply about chords and a melody. Sometimes what’s not playing is as important as what is.”\n\nAnother change is Lewis’ first recorded duet, on the spectral ‘Slumber’ featuring Lucy Rose, whom Lewis first heard at college and has been angling to work with ever since. The gorgeous melancholy there is touched on elsewhere in the likes of ‘Forever’ which is simultaneously Midnight’s poppiest song, but also one of its saddest.\n\n“I’ve always wanted to write a really sad, upbeat song,” says Lewis. “It’s about the frustration of being in a relationship that’s not working, despite you both wanting it to. The setting is so upbeat and instant, it tricks you in to thinking it’s happy until you really listen to the lyrics.”\n\nThe album closes with the secret title track, a Joel Pott co-write featuring Josephine on piano that returns Lewis to the stripped-back beauty of his early releases. Whilst hidden from the tracklisting it’s deeply revealing of an artist coming full circle, fulfilling his early promise while expanding his palette in ever more vibrant ways – something reflected in the striking album artwork commissioned from renowned Canadian painter Andrew Salgado, one of Lewis’ favourite artists.\n\n“I studied art at school and cheekily emailed him with an idea,” says Lewis. “He said he admired my gusto and agreed.”\n\nSo what does the artwork tell us about the music contained on Midnight, and more specifically about its creator? “It’s an incredible, heavily textured painting of me,” Lewis explains. “It’s not at all clear, so it’s me, but it’s not me. Or maybe it’s a different me, one you weren’t expecting.”\n\nAnd that’s the perfect image for the album, because with Midnight Lewis Watson has not just evolved but been reborn, creating magic with a new sound, a new look and a new career stretching ahead. This time there is no doubt – like his heroes, Lewis will be making music for the rest of his life.",

  "artistSummary": "What does deep house, the work of Stockhausen, a self-programmed snake and a frozen Lily Cole have in common? No, it’s not the contents of a lost episode of Skins. Nor is it the XX’s Christmas list. It is, rather, just a few of the details that make up Clean Bandit, a new four-piece that in their playfulness and willingness to trample over musical boundaries offer a refreshing new direction for dance music in 2013. Forget your rock revivalists or your retrofitted soul crooners, Clean Bandit could not have emerged at any time other than now. Comprised of brothers Jack and Luke Patterson alongside the classically-trained pair of Grace Chatto and Neil Amin-Smith, the group formed in 2008. One night , in the dingy confines of a Cambridge nightclub, classic music met bass music, and it never looked back. “It was at the band’s own club night called National Rail Disco. We set it up because we thought there was a real lack of new interesting music at the time. The first ever one was basically set up so we could perform. But as it carried on it became more of a straightforward club night we DJ’d or played live most weeks alongside other DJs and electronic acts we loved.” The students, not normally thought to be a particularly clubby kind of crowd, were into it. “They loved it, it was really successful and always completely packed”, says Jack. “People didn’t expect the students to be into it, but they were. They all had a real appetite for the music. One of the coolest things was the night we had James Blake down. Three quarters of the way through his set he just played a Destiny’s Child acapella on its own. Even though there was no beat,. people just went completely off. That was amazing.” National Rail Disco provided Clean Bandit with a blueprint for everything that was to follow. First, there was a willingness to take risks. Second a desire to blend beats and strings. Third, it was done in a DIY fashion, using whatever resources were to hand.â€¨But first they decided to move to Moscow. Grace to learn the language and play cello. Jack followed her, and ended up enrolling in Russia’s famous film school, The Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography. “I didn’t have much to do in Moscow and someone mentioned a film course that was open to international students so I thought I’d give it a try. It was a five year course,” Jack recalls. “I didn’t do the whole thing, but the whole of the first year you only do black and white still images. In the second year you do moving images but still only in black and white. It was all in Russian too, and to begin with none of the students spoke a word of it.” It was at the Gerasimov that Jack’s ideas of blending music recordings with filmmaking began to take shape. “I was making music on a laptop a lot while I was there”, he says. “It was still a hobby though. I had long days at film school and then would come home and have a go messing around making music. I wrote Mozart’s House while I was out there. I was listening to a lot of house music there, there was a little boutique outside our flat that would blast out house for 24 hours. Maybe that seeped in.” Now, in 2013, Clean Bandit are still mixing things up. Currently residing in London, this electroquartet are applying their principles to a whole new range of possibilities. Listen to single ‘A&E’ and you’ll hear classical, bucolic strings intertwining with UK funky bass and a melody of modern electronic pop. It’s a new sophisticated sound, but one that’s distinctive of our capital. The soulful vocals, meanwhile, are sung by guests Kandaka Moore and Nikki Marshall, found by chance in the group’s new home of Kilburn. “They were part of local community singing and dancing group next door to our studio”, says Jack. “We thought they would be perfect for this track.” And so they are, sharing the enthusiasm of the track and, also, the versatility of the group. Moore also volunteered as a dancer for the video, which necessitated her being part of a stop-motion animation. “She was completely unfazed by being painted gold over the course of two hours”, notes Jack. That was far from being the most complicated part of the production, by the way. The video for A&E also required the creation of a golden snake. A serpent that, as in a real life game of Snake, slithered across central London. It was a challenge, one that Jack – typically – took it upon himself to rise to. So how do you make a snake? “We made it on the computer”, he says. “I taught myself to use Cinema 4D. I studied architecture at uni, so I had kind of got into 3d graphics, modeling and animation. Luke learned how to do the fluid dynamics, because the snake had to go through water at the beginning.” Clean Bandit have also been getting a taste of a different experience closer to home whilst on tour this spring with teenage chart conquerors Disclosure. “The tour was really fun”, says Jack. “It was great to see how that world worked and to be in these really cool clubs up and down the country was brilliant. There were screaming fans. We had people who knew the words to our songs, which was quite amazing to see. It was unexpected.”â€¨The stakes were raised even higher for new single ‘Dust Clears’. This concept video, also directed by Jack, was half-filmed on the frozen lakes of northern Sweden in winter. “In this video all the band work in a factory, but the lead singer is an older guy who’s got this fantasy of being an ice skater”, says Jack, with a smile. “We filmed the skating in Sweden and that was great, we used some special techniques. Two of us were towed along on a sled with two different lenses, two cameras filming our dear friend Nick as he skated past. Nick is our friend’s dad and while we were thinking about making the video we heard that when he was 17 he was a Scottish figure skating champion. When you see the video, you’ll see why we found this quite amazing.” Quite clearly kids of the internet generation, Clean Bandit aren’t precious about where they find inspiration or how they deploy it (the aforementioned Lily Cole volunteered to stand in a freezing cold swimming pool for the video to UK Shanty, in return for Jack giving her a tutorial on her new video camera). Neither are they devoted to one type of creativity. They make music, they make video, they perform live. “We try to think of each piece as being a music video rather than a song”, says Jack. “Videos for songs is the output. That’s how we’d like it to be digested. Now we’re doing more and more music, we’re having to make stuff without the videos, but hopefully we’ll be able to catch up.”",

It turns out, though, that once the door’s open, it never closes. That’s because the Melbourne septet has ingeniously crafted what may be the world’s first infinitely looping LP. Each of the nine, complex, blistering tracks on ‘Nonagon Infinity’ seamlessly flows into the next, with the final song linking straight back into the top of the opener like a sonic mobius strip. It’s exactly the kind of ambitious vision that prompted Rolling Stone to dub the band “one of the most compelling collectives of art-rock experimentalists in recent years.” But far from a simple conceptual experiment, the album is both an exhilarating shot of adrenaline and a remarkable feat of craftsmanship, the result of painstaking planning and an eye for detail years in the making.",

  "artistSummary": "BAYSIDEAnthony Raneri – Vocals, Guitar Jack O’Shea – Lead Guitar Nick Ghanbarian – Bass Chris Guglielmo – Drums Bayside fans don’t call their relationship with the band a “Cult” for nothing. After a string of much-adored releases, Bayside has one of the most dedicated fan bases in rock, and the group steadfastly rewards those devotees with the musical salvation they seek. Six albums and more than a decade later, Bayside has never lost touch with that mission and, in fact, they’ve only grown bigger. While veteran bands take breaks and regroup, Bayside haven’t taken that route and instead, soldiered on, building up and growing more and more into themselves… to the point in which they are the most “Bayside” that they have ever been. The fact that their audience has grown is testament to that. Now continuing that legacy is the band’s latest creation, an explosive 11-track collection that captures Bayside in prime form, combining classic elements from throughout their career. Guaranteed to rock the faithful, the new release is appropriately entitled Cult. “When we were done with the record we were like, ‘This is every Bayside record,’” explains singer/guitarist Anthony Raneri. “It has the honesty and rawness that we’ve had since Sirens And Condolences, and those risks: those weird key and time signature changes, and the different styles of music we explore. The Bayside ‘Cult’ is something our fans have been talking about for a long time, and it seemed like a good name for a greatest hits album, which is kind of what this is: a Bayside discography. On the cover, there are even little symbols to signify each album.” That’s a lot of history for an album cover. The band—which also includes lead guitarist Jack O’Shea, bassist Nick Ghanbarian and drummer Chris Guglielmo—formed in the winter of 2000 in Queens, NY, undergoing numerous lineup changes in the early years. At first through Raneri’s sheer persistence and dedication Bayside progressed, eventually cutting two embryonic EPs with Dying Wish Records. Those efforts bore fruit, leading to a contract with Victory Records in 2003, resulting in the band’s 2004 full-length debut, Sirens & Condolences. But it was just the beginning, and the group released three more quintessential LPs with Victory, cementing their place as one of the most important bands in the modern underground music scene—Self-Titled (2005), The Walking Wounded (2007) and Shudder (2008)—then briefly moved on to Wind-Up Records in 2010 for Killing Time (2011), their most widely visible album to date. After that record cycle Bayside opened another exciting new chapter in their career, signing with punk powerhouse Hopeless Records in 2013. Cult marks the band’s first Hopeless release. For latest effort Cult, Bayside spent roughly two years writing new material, then returned to producer Shep Goodman (who’d previously helmed two of Bayside’s most beloved releases, Self-Titled and Walking Wounded), as well as Goodman’s production partner, Aaron Accetta. Raneri says Goodman was a catalyst for the band’s obvious progression from debut Sirens to sophomore album Self-Titled, and this latest collaboration sought to rekindle that spark. “Shep was very instrumental in teaching me about songwriting. He taught me a lot about drawing a listener in and getting inside the mind of the listener, and not just sitting down with a guitar and playing whatever comes to mind,” says Raneri. “He’s sort of my mentor as far as songwriting goes. I loved working with Gil Norton on the last record [Killing Time]—he’s a legend, and it was an amazing process—but with this record, I really wanted to get back and hone in, try to get better at my songwriting again. I knew that working with Shep has always done that for me.” Sonically, Cult is perhaps the band’s most confident and resonant work to date, featuring turbocharged rhythms and the consistently blistering guitar work of six-string whiz O’Shea. But as much as the album is a return to the band’s musical sweet spot, on the other hand Cult’s lyrical content breaks new thematic ground, showcasing Raneri’s ongoing personal growth as both the man and the songwriter. Instead of dwelling on past romantic failings, this time the lyricist points his pen at the hard matters of life and death, having recently lost his grandfather, stepfather and stepbrother. “[Cult] is pretty different because it’s not about broken relationships as much as other records; on a personal level, my relationship has been great, my marriage is good and I’ve started a family. Instead a lot of this record deals with mortality, without it being morbid,” says Raneri. “I lost a lot of people who were close to me, and it really just started making me think a lot about what my legacy was going to be. What am I going to leave behind and what is my entire generation going to leave behind? What are they going to be saying at funerals 40 years from now? It’s wondering if life is about leaving a legacy. Is that what we’re all here for: living a life worth remembering?” Raneri channels these universal existential questions into personal inspiration on tracks like first single “Time Has Come,” which finds the singer challenging himself to rise to the occasion over intricately interwoven guitar lines. “It’s meant to be more of an uplifting thing,” says Raneri. “If I want to make something of myself, build a legacy, accomplish something, then I’ve got to just go do it. The time is now to do something if you ever plan on it.” Other tracks like “Stuttering” and “Bear With Me” put the music business under the microscope, as well as Bayside’s place within it. “[“Bear”] has a lot to do with my career and my legacy as a musician. You look at bands like mine, and it’s hard to ignore that a lot of pop-punk or mid-2000s emo bands just sort of disappeared,” says Raneri, who’s instead had the good fortune of seeing Bayside’s popularity continually grow. “Fortunately for us our band has been able to make it through a lot of that. There are definitely days when I feel like I’m a novelty, but like the line in the song, I think I’m twice the man I used to be.” Even when Raneri does return to issues of the heart, he does so with a newfound perspective. A prime example is the song “Transitive Property,” which Raneri wrote during Warped Tour 2012 for his girlfriend—now his wife—as a heartfelt apology, as the couple was on the verge of a breakup. Although never intended for public ears, when bandmates heard the song they insisted it be included on the new album. “That’s the most personal song I’ve ever written. It’s like sharing a letter to the world; sharing my actual diary that I didn’t think anybody would see,” Raneri says. “I always write a song with the intention of sharing it, but that lyrically was the first song I wrote that was so personal because I thought nobody would ever hear it. I think it’s a great song; one of the best songs I ever wrote.” Bayside has already toured the world many times over, sharing stages with a virtual “who’s who” of like-minded artists and enjoying regular main-stage spots at major festivals like Warped Tour, but the band’s plans for the coming year are no less ambitious. After Cult drops in February, Bayside will head out on a U.S. headlining tour, then travel to Europe with Alkaline Trio in the spring. From there Bayside will likely play still more high-profile North American dates during the summer of 2014. “I’m excited about the tour, because it’s sort of a combination of underplayed and big shows,” says Raneri. “We’re in certain cities playing bigger venues than we’ve ever played, and in some cities we’re playing in smaller venues.” Now six full-lengths into their career, making the setlist each night gets tougher than ever. Raneri says the band is cautious of including too much new material live, for risking of disappointing fans awaiting the classics, but once listeners have Cult in their hands it’ll be easier to gauge which new tracks to perform. Inevitably though, Cult will stand up well next to past material. If there’s one thing immediately clear, it’s that Cult is as classic Bayside as it comes. “We don’t play anything we don’t want, but at the same time, we listen to our fans, and we know what makes Bayside, Bayside. We try to grab all those things that we all love about Bayside and try to do more of them,” says Raneri. “People’s lives change. You go from high school to college to adulthood to parenthood, and everything in your life changes, except there’s always going to be a new Bayside record, and you can always go home.” less… less…Anthony Raneri – Vocals, Guitar Jack O’Shea – Lead Guitar Nick Ghanbarian – Bass Chris Guglielmo – Drums Bayside fans don’t call their relationship with the band a “Cult” for nothing.

   "Laura Marling with Valley Queen"

  "headliner": "Laura Marling with Valley Queen",
  "date": "2017-04-30",
  "startTime": "7:00",
  "cost": 27,
  "artistSummary": "Laura Marling\n                      There is a line from Virgil’s epic poem The Aeneid that nearly a decade ago Laura Marling decided to have tattooed on her leg: “Varium et mutabile semper femina” it runs, translating roughly as “A woman is an ever fickle and changeable thing.” Realizing that the line was a little long for the limb, at the very last moment she opted instead for an abbreviation: “Semper femina” she chose: “Always a woman.” It makes a fitting and fascinating title for Marling’s sixth album — an intimate, devoted exploration of femininity and female relationships, and among her finest work to date. Written largely on the tour that followed 2015’s Short Movie and recorded in Los Angeles with production from Blake Mills, it is at once a distinctive and musically compelling collection of songs, run through with Marling’s fierce intelligence; a keen, beautiful and unparalleled take on womanhood.\n“I started out writing it as if a man was writing about a woman,” Marling says. “And then I thought it’s not a man, it’s me — I don’t need to pretend it’s a man to justify the intimacy of the way I’m looking and feeling about women. It’s me looking specifically at women and feeling great empathy towards them and by proxy towards myself.”\nThe songs grew out of what Marling regards as “a masculine time” in her life. “A certain time when I’d sort of gone on this trip of abandoning any sexuality,” she says. “Now in retrospect I was hopped up on the times, but I was living in LA, and LA does have an amazing knack for removing sexuality. I found it quite scary; I was scared of what I perceived to be the disappearance of my feminine side. But it gave me an ability to look at women in a different way and consider how I’d been looked at.”\nIn retrospect there was a precursor to this strange period of her life — Short Movie had been concerned with the breaking down of the ego, “And then I guess piecing back together an ego you get to see it in all its parts,” she says. “And tied in with this was the magical realism of living in LA.” Having spent several years in Los Angeles, Marling now splits her time between the UK and California. “And LA makes me feel very different to England,” she says. “Now my love affair with LA is at a point where I don’t really leave my house and all my friends are English. It’s a great place to be, but it’s not an enticing fantastical adventure anymore, and I think the election has brought that home.”\nMarling’s exploration of femininity is as broad as it is tender. On tracks such as Wild Once she was interested in the archetype of the wild woman and her unrestrained physicality. “In the more masculine phase of my life I got really into hiking and bouldering, scrambling up trees or whatever,” she explains. “And I just hadn’t exercised that part of myself for such a long time, and it was felt fantastic. It touched something that was really sweet and innocent. At a time when I couldn’t really find that center, I was touching on it running through a forest by Big Sur with no shoes on.”\nElsewhere she’s looking at “What’s been forbidden to me in female relationships in all forms, and at female empathy between each other, and friendships that have been really intense.” On The Valley, for instance, a track she calls “a bit of an English nostalgia trip” she writes about “broken female friendships, and how that feels to be betrayed or betray a friend or a woman in any way.”\nThe nature of female friendship has been a long-standing interest for Marling. “And again it’s blurred as you open up the boundaries more,” she says. “But the falling in love that you experience with friendship is so less defined than romantic or sexual love. I’ve been obsessed with that always I think,” she says. “Because I have sisters maybe, and a mother. And I think because of that there’s a high standard of trust and care that I place on myself and that I feel in my female friends as well — we have quite a high empathetic standard for each other. So I feel when that’s broken it’s so powerful. And I’m guilty of that in many respects because I’m so absent-minded. Until now I just hadn’t really thought about that being a subject matter for a song, but when I tapped into the sadness of that, or the regret, or the feeling of being on the other side of that, I found that quite a fruitful well of stuff. So there’s a lot of that on this record, that trying to make amends for those sort of broken channels.”\nShe also became fascinated by the life of the psychoanalyst Lou Andreas-Salome. “I came across her by accident through a love letter that [Rainer Maria] Rilke wrote,” Marling says. “I was obsessed with Rilke, and he wrote about her being the only tangible thing that he’d ever encountered in his life — the famous quote is ‘You alone are real to me’.” Marling read about Andreas-Salome extensively — from her upbringing in Russia, through her intellectual and romantic relationships with figures such as Paul Ree, Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud, her unconsummated marriage to Friedrich Carl Andreas, and her passionate affair with Rilke which led to his Duino elegies.\nRather than her relationships with famous male figures it was Andreas-Salome’s own psychoanalytic research that Marling found particularly interesting: “Just before Freud died she wrote him a letter saying ‘I’ve been doing some research into the feminine psyche and I think you’ve got it completely wrong. Penis envy is an invention of man because women’s sexuality by its nature is internal and self-perpetuating, so there’s no lack of this or need of that. It’s this internal, inherently creative thing without men.’ And Freud wrote to her and said this is amazing and this is true, but he died two months later so it never got published. And that blew my mind. Imagine! It would’ve changed the entire psyche of the western world.”\nThese thoughts were shaped further by Marling’s ongoing podcast project Reversal of the Muse which saw her interviewing women from across the music industry — from famed singers such as Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris to female sound engineers, and guitar shop owners, discussing the nature and shape of female creativity. “I would say that feminine creativity, the feminine part of the brain is in both sexes, but is inherently different to the masculine,” she says, for me, playing guitar has always been tied up with my identity, it’s always been involved in myself, rather than enticing people in.”\nHaving produced Short Movie herself, Marling decided to enlist Mills as producer for Semper Femina. “I really enjoyed producing but it’s just not my calling,” she says. “I’d love to do it for someone else, but for myself it was too difficult to play both roles. Making the podcasts I discovered I play off the vulnerability of being a solo human being, playing a very vulnerable song in front of a microphone with six people in a control room. It’s a weird dynamic, but it has always worked for me. A lot of songwriters I know can’t bear to be overheard when they’re songwriting, but I quite like it — I write in venues or dressing rooms when there are eight people in the room. There’s something thrilling and weirdly voyeuristic about it. But I like the idea that it will be heard, and if I’m producing it feels like it might only be heard by me.”\nLooking for a producer, and already a fan of his music, she was told that Mills had written a list of people he wanted to work with and that her name was on it. This is not to say recording was always straightforward, and working with a new, male producer brought familiar challenges for Marling. “I think Blake was very sweetly not sure what to do with an English girl,” she says. “It took a week or two to shake off the very set image of what I was in his mind — a very romping through the countryside delicate character from Emma. And I’ve had that so many times. And in some ways I’m think you can keep that image of me, but in other ways I have to break it in order to get work done, because it’s a really heavy block between you and what you want to get done. And also because I’d just come from producing a record myself I had to get rid of that idea of delicacy.”\nMore than anything on Semper Femina Marling addresses the space between the perceptions and realities of being a woman, the space in which women are not frail but powerful, creative and abundant figures. “When I was a teenager in my head you were either this delicate tragedy or you were a muse,” she says. “And they’re both such horrifyingly subjugated roles. But our culture loves female tragedy. That’s just been so ingrained over and over again, and there haven’t been enough examples of a written alternative. My main focus is re-writing the idea of tragic woman.”\nIf Marling sounds galvanized it’s because this album marks a shift in her career. “The time and the political climate that we live in, we’re coming to a point where there’s no need for this sort of artistic expression that I’ve been a part of,” she says. “Innocent creativity had a little flourish in the last ten years. But also I’m getting older and now I think ‘What use is that?’ It’s not rooted, not pointed, not political. For me right now I feel like it’s more important that I have a practical use.”",

From Phoenix to NYC and from Boston to South Florida to Scotland, she's toured as a mostly-solo act, collecting stories and creating musical vignettes while headlining at nationally recognized venues such as Club Passim, The Bitter End, and The Freight and Salvage.\n\nGarlin started her career as a school teacher. All the while there has been another call to adventure, a tugging on the guitar strings that has moved her to write and record and tour and perform. Her April 2015 release, Wink at July, continues in the folk-rock storytelling vein that brought her accolades from the New York Songwriter’s Circle, Performing Songwriter Magazine, and won her first place in the Newport Folk Festival’s Talent Search. Media fans include Curve Magazine (“storytelling at its best” ) and Diffuser Magazine (“an impressive catalogue of unforgettable stories.”) Garlin’s songs have also aired on Click and Clack's Car Talk, NPR’s Democracy Now, and radio stations throughout the country. Her live performances bring together a natural stage presence and the same folk, rock, and Americana flavors that season her recordings.",

  "artistSummary": "Eliza Rickman\nThere is always a hint of menace and reservoirs of force haunting the corners of Eliza Rickman’s voice, whatever register it occupies. Her presence on stage- whether she wears flowers in her hair, or stuffed birds; whether she plays a toy piano or a grand piano- is an enveloping, soft darkness, impossible to ignore. It has been three years between Rickman's first album, O, You Sinners, and her newest effort, Footnotes for the Spring. In those intervening three years, Rickman added the autoharp to her repertoire, fought illness and heartbreak (and won), and turned 30. But mostly, she toured. She is a frequent featured musical act for the live rendition of the popular podcast Welcome to Night Vale, she joined the band Rasputina for a handful of dates, and she organized her own successful solo European tour.\n\nDuring those three years, Rickman’s vocal delivery has also developed a new breathlessness. She wrote all the string arrangements on her debut. But friend Jason Webley produced and orchestrated Footnotes. Here, Rickman’s voice casts its shadow against Webley’s shimmering strings and a Phil Spector style wall of sound, flecked with melancholy and nostalgia. This clutch of songs comprises, among others, “Lark of my Heart”, written to commemorate the wedding day of Margaret Rucker, an unknown poet whose scrapbook was found in a dumpster many years after her death; “Now and Then”, whose opening lines encapsulate the juxtaposition at the heart of the album- Oh, to be young again/blood is on my hands- and “Wax Nostalgic”, whose title speaks for itself. But this is nostalgia without sentimentality. Rickman’s voice has the power to hold the smallest grain of sadness, an intimation that the longed-for innocence depicted in her lyrics has slipped just below the glow of the orchestra and out of sight.",

Harlow’s Monkeys is certainly the latter; fronted by Bay Area native, Tommy P, he teams up with New York City’s sister duo, King Willow. The result is a lush weary sound that’s introspective, yet abundantly hopeful. \n\nTommy’s lyrical style is very simple, yet is capable of addressing with full poignancy the heart of the matter, whether it's unrequited love or the existential ennui that plagues us modern humans. People often comment on the ambiance Tommy’s songs have on a room, whether it's slightly unsettling, welcoming or humorous, it can’t be ignored, and won’t fail to make an impression. Harlow’s Monkeys is a band that functions around the idea that music should be provocative and true. While some may claim that we are “post the truth,\" Harlow’s Monkeys firmly believes that all beings recognize truth when they see or hear it. This band’s music will take you through the journeys or emotions that you may have long forgotten, or that you’re currently going through. \n\nIn any case, listeners will often finish a Harlow’s Monkeys record feeling refreshed by the archetypical stories funneled through the quirky yet provocative voice of Tommy’s writing fleshed out by various good friends and musicians that make up the San Francisco music scene.",

A cross-country move to San Francisco in 2014 deepened the love and longing for his southern roots, and now; at age 27, a seasoned blend of blues, country, and bluegrass can be heard in Andrew’s recorded music and live performances.\n\nOriginally inspired by the authenticity of 'outlaw' country songwriters Steve Earle and Guy Clark, Andrew's interests quickly shifted towards the blues; particularly The Allman Brothers, BB King, and Otis Redding. These artists' soulful performances left a lasting mark on Andrew, who makes a point of approaching every song through a bluesy lens, regardless of genre.\n\nA performer since age 19, Andrew is an equally adept bandleader and solo-performer who brings energy and passion to every show. With 3 self-released EPs under his belt, including the recently released 'EP3' (2/2017), Andrew is also a dedicated songwriter with a relentless push towards honesty and simplicity in his lyrics. Having spent the last several years paying his dues as a full-time dive-bar performer, the time is ripe for Andrew’s seasoned act to hit the road and the airwaves as a new voice in traditional blues and country music.",

  "startTime": "7:00",
  "cost": 21,
  "artistSummary": "Simply put,  has spent nearly 25 years making music that defies description. While the Chicago-based instrumental quintet has nodded to dub, rock, jazz, electronica and minimalism throughout its revered and influential six-album discography, the resulting sounds have always been distinctly, even stubbornly, their own.\nIt's a fact that remains true on \"The Catastrophist,\" Tortoise's first studio album in nearly seven years. And it's an album where moody, synth-swept jams like the opening title track cozy up next to hypnotic, bass-and-beat missives like \"Shake Hands With Danger\" and a downright strange cover of David Essex's 1973 radio smash sung by U.S. Maple's Todd Rittmann. Throughout, the songs transcend expectations as often as they delight the eardrums.\nTortoise, comprised of multi-instrumentalists Dan Bitney, John Herndon, Doug McCombs, John McEntire and Jeff Parker, has always thrived on sudden bursts of inspiration. And for \"The Catastrophist,\" the spark came in 2010 when the group was commissioned by the City of Chicago to compose a suite of music rooted in its ties to the area's noted jazz and improvised music communities.\nTortoise then performed those five loose themes at a handful of concerts, and \"when we finally got around to talking about a new record, the obvious solution to begin with was to take those pieces and see what else we could do with them,\" says McEntire, at whose Soma Studios the band recorded the new album. \"It turned out that for them to work for Tortoise, they needed a bit more of a rethink in terms of structure. They're all pretty different in the sense that at first they were just heads and solos. Now, they're orchestrated and complex.\"\n\"All of the songs went through a pretty intensive process of restructuring,\" adds Parker. \"We actually had quite a lot of material that we ended up giving up on. Oftentimes, we'll shelve ideas and come back to them years later.\"\nThe album's single \"Gesceap\" embodies the transformation of the original suite commissions, as it morphs from two gently intersecting synth lines into a pounding, frenzied full-band finish. \"To a certain extent it's more of a reflection of how we actually sound when we play live,\" says McEntire of Tortoise's heavier side. \"That hasn't always been captured as well on past albums.\"\nElsewhere, \"Hot Coffee\" resurrects an idea abandoned from the band's 2004 album \"It's All Around You,\" gliding through only-on-aTortoise-album sections of funktastic bass lines, straight-up dance beats and Parker's fusion-flecked guitar bursts. \"It's progressive experimental music with pop sensibilities,\" says Parker.\n\"Rock On,\" which McEntire says he and McCombs simultaneously had the idea to cover after having remembered hearing it on the radio all the time as kids, isn't the only vocal moment on \"The Catastrophist.\" Also included is the bittersweet, honest-to-goodness soul ballad \"Yonder Blue,\" sung by Yo La Tengo's Georgia Hubley. \"We'd finished the track and decided it would be good to have vocals on it,\" recalls McEntire. \"Robert Wyatt was our first choice, but he had just retired and politely said no. We were discussing asking Georgia to do something, but not that track in particular. Then we realized it would totally work.\"\nTortoise is planning an extensive world tour in support of \"The Catastrophist.\" Admits McEntire, \"figuring out how to reproduce these songs live will be a bit of a challenge. But I also feel like it might be time to dip into the back catalog a bit. The pool we draw from has been really consistent for quite awhile.\nAs ever, Tortoise has conjured sounds on \"The Catastrophist\" that aren't being purveyed anywhere else in music today. There's a deeply intuitive interplay between the group members that comes only from two decades of experimentation, revision and improvisation. And at a time when our brains are constantly bombarded by myriad distractions, \"The Catastrophist\" reminds us that there's something much greater out there. All we have to do is listen.\nTICKET INFORMATION• Great American Music Hall is an ALL-AGES (6+) venue.• No refunds or exchanges are permitted, except in the case of headliner cancellation or date change.

  "artistSummary": "On April 1, 2016, Chris Purkea released Back in the Ring. She left her home base of Portland, OR and embarked on a tour with her band that found them crisscrossing the United States and Europe playing over 70 shows in less than a year. Now, one year later, Chris is heading out for a string of U.S. tour dates to celebrate the upcoming April 2017 release of her new live CD / DVD combo, which was recorded during the Back in the Ring release tour at Jammin Java in Vienna, VA.\nChris’s elegant emotionality as a vocalist, and her flair and immediacy as a lyricist have garnered her favorable comparisons to Gillian Welch, Ryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen, and Patty Griffin. She’s earned accolades from such distinguished taste-making outlets as The New York Times, Paste, Magnet, Billboard.com, and The AllMusic Guide. She’s shared the stage with such diverse and esteemed artists as Dar Williams, The Lumineers, The Cowboy Junkies, Gregory Alan Isakov, Martin Sexton, and Ani DiFranco. Along the way, Chris has remained fiercely independent, selling over 50,000 albums through her own label, Sad Rabbit Records.\nTICKET INFORMATION• Great American Music Hall is an ALL-AGES (6+) venue.• No refunds or exchanges are permitted, except in the case of headliner cancellation or date change.

  "artistSummary": "On sale Friday, 2/17 @ 10am\nWhen  takes the stage, satisfaction is guaranteed – and she’s willing to pack as many entendres into that promise as you can take. With a voice fit for an elegant ballroom, a mouth better suited for the local dive bar and a mind completely at ease in the gutter outside, Savalas puts on a dazzling and daring show that will make you dance, laugh, swoon and fidget uncomfortably in your seat. She’s a consummate show-woman with a take-no-prisoners (unless you’re into that sort of thing) attitude that might just make her this generation’s Bette Midler.\nSavalas marries – well, she’s not really the marrying type; let’s just say she engages in a series of one-night stands with – Gatsby-esque decadence and Snapchat sensibility, swing era sophistication and Sunset Strip grit. A singer, dancer, songwriter, actress and chanteuse, over the course of an evening she can seduce, surprise and touch you – sometimes literally. It’s like 3-D with a couple of extra Ds thrown in for good measure.\nNot afraid to get her hands dirty unraveling the messy entanglements of love, sex and relationships in all their multifarious variations, Savalas takes on the role of the lover you always wanted, the ex you never got rid of, or the best friend who won’t stop drunk-dialing. You’ll leave her performances humming a new melody and stifling a laugh while regretting your life choices and scrolling through your contacts to figure out who’s up.\nIf Savalas seems born to be on the stage, that’s probably because she was. Her father was actor Telly Savalas, whose larger-than-life persona and arched-eyebrow sense of humor she inherited. She grew up living an Eloise-like existence in Los Angeles’ Sheraton Universal Hotel, wrapping herself in the curtains to put on homemade shows for the man who played the lollipop-sucking detective Kojak and the dirtiest of the Dirty Dozen. After his passing in 1994 she moved with her family to Minnesota and attended a convent school during her teens – and if Hollywood seems like a corrupting environment, try living with nuns for three years.\nBut she brings more than a fairy-tale childhood and a string of broken hearts to her act; Savalas attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, where she studied more than the men in tights – her provocative wordplay reveal the lessons she soaked up on Shakespeare and poetry. Back in L.A. she became a member of Playhouse West, the repertory theater company co-founded by Jeff Goldblum, from whom she gleaned the art of combining the quirky and the alluring.\nSavalas found a group of kindred spirits in the vintage-pop mash-up project Postmodern Jukebox. Their collaborations, timeless in a way that parallels her own music, have garnered millions of views and reached #1 on the iTunes jazz charts. She’s traveled the world with them on tour, playing in renowned venues like Radio City Music Hall and the O2 at Roundhouse in London. There is no stage too big for Ariana to get up close and personal in the eyes, ears, hearts and more forbidden places of her audiences.\nTICKET INFORMATION• Great American Music Hall is an ALL-AGES (6+) venue.• No refunds or exchanges are permitted, except in the case of headliner cancellation or date change.

Their original songs are instantly familiar and inviting, and their easygoing versions of timeless classics (the Beatles, Hank Williams) belie the intricacy of the arrangements.” – San Francisco Chronicle\nHot Buttered Rum lives for a good time, and a mindful recklessness settles in whenever these five guys step on stage. From Anchorage to Miami, the group’s onstage chemistry fuels the lovefest that is a live Butter show. Rooted in the trajectory of west coast bluegrass, Hot Buttered Rum plays what has been described as California’s own acoustic music.\nHBR’s years of touring have given the band the chance to work and play with a wide cross-section of musicians, people like Peter Rowan, Phil Lesh, Chris Thile, Brett Dennen, and Robert Earl Keen. Seasoned veteran Steve Berlin (Los Lobos), acoustic guru Mike Marshall, and left-coast rocker Tim Bluhm (Mother Hips, Nicki Bluhm) have all produced studio albums for the band. Each guided HBR towards the next step in its evolution. It’s a sound that is tough to describe and easy to love, and it has found its way to the most prestigious pop, folk, and bluegrass stages in the country: Telluride, Newport, Bonnaroo, Strawberry, Hardly Strictly, Kate Wolf, Horning’s Hideout, String Summit, Grey Fox, Merlefest, All Good, High Sierra, Wakarusa, and many more.\nThe next step in Butter’s evolution involves recording three 5-song EPs, each focusing on a part of music that Hot Buttered Rum loves and is inspired by, and each with a different producer. The first EP was recently recorded with Railroad Earth’s Tim Carbone and will be released this fall. The second will be a collection of Ralph Stanley old school bluegrass standards, to be recorded in September with producer Sally Van Meter. The third will be Hot Buttered Rum’s latenight throwdown music, to be recorded in November with SCI’s Kyle Hollingsworth. Together, the three collections of songs will explore Butter’s roots and express Butter’s present passions.\nAt the center of Hot Buttered Rum is the enduring camaraderie of old friends. The band was conceived on a backpacking trip of high school and college buddies in the High Sierra. What was dreamed up on mountaintops and around campfires has found its way into the hearts, minds, and bodies of thousands.\nTICKET INFORMATION• Great American Music Hall is an ALL-AGES (6+) venue.• No refunds or exchanges are permitted, except in the case of headliner cancellation or date change.

Tasked with introducing Wondervisions, Delicate Steve's beguiling debut record of highly evocative and emotionally concise guitar-driven songs, Luaka Bop, the seminal David Byrne-owned New York indie label, balked. There was the music to get to; itself essentially reference-less and unqualifiedly unique. But what of the guy who created it? The guitarist who wrote the whole thing, who played every instrument. An enormous unknown talent without an attendant backstory to match the spectral and boundless qualities of his music. Enter Chuck Klosterman. The celebrated writer was brought on to completely fabricate a biography based on a band and album he was asked not to listen to.",

Born on the Jazz & Heritage Festival stage, and descended from Neville family bloodlines, these soldiers of funk ignite a deep, gritty groove that dares listeners not to move. Their performances combine ingenious musicianship and complex funk and jazz arrangements with soulful melodies that are simple enough for anyone to enjoy. In Big Easy tradition, dueling baselines from Tony Hall and Nick Daniels III set off one of the dirtiest rhythm sections on the planet, while Ivan Neville lights up the Hammond B3 keys and cousin Ian Neville’s funky guitar riffs send the groove into overdrive. The band recently welcomed their newest member, Alvin Ford Jr. to the quintet, a New Orleans born and raised powerhouse drummer. Dumpstaphunk tosses around lead vocals and four-part harmonies the way Sly & the Family Stone did, but with three studio albums under their belt, Dumpstaphunk stands on the merit of their own material. Songs like “Dancin’ To The Truth” off their latest record, Dirty Word (Red Hot Records), offer an escape into the funky sublime, sharing the true spirit of New Orleans with every note.",

  "artistSummary": "Innocence Reaches begins with a query. \"How do you identify?\" coos a robotic voice over a strikingly modern mix of bright synthpop and surging rave. The question too feels very of its time—as outdated ideas about gender and attraction are being overturned—but it's also a fair ask whenever  debuts an album.\nThe project's 14th LP follows two full decades of mercurial creative mania: swallowing up '60s psych-pop, Prince-ly funk, and glammy prog in turn; morphing freely between full-band affair and cloistered confessional booth; comprising lyrics both painfully personal and absurdly fantastical; and recently drawing site-specific inspiration from culture capitals like San Francisco or New York City. The thread that runs through it all is Athens, GA's Kevin Barnes, and Innocence Reaches finds him at his most light-hearted in years, working a Parisian stint, Top 40 sounds, and his newfound single status into the kaleidoscopic swirl. Even as he continues to sift the sonic and emotional detritus of his past, Barnes sums up his current mood in the opener's title: \"let's relate.\"\nThe most immediate surprise is the sound. Innocence Reaches is touched by contemporary electronica, indie pop, and EDM. For the first time in his career, Barnes tuned into now. \"Forever I've been detached from current music,\" he says. \"I got into this bubble of only being in some other time period. I came up picking apart the Beach Boys, the Beatles, and symphonic pieces. But last year, I was hearing Jack Ü, Chairlift, Arca, and others, thinking about low end and sound collage. It was an extra layer to geek out on.\"\nParis helped with that. Barnes lived in a friend's studio for two weeks. It was in an apartment complex and, as he prefers to work at night, he couldn't thrash loud instruments for fear of noise complaints from the neighbors. But the in-house arsenal of vintage synthesizers and drum machines was fair game—check the skittering beats of \"a sport and a pastime\" and thick hum of \"chap pilot.\"\nBy day, Barnes wandered Père Lachaise Cemetery, sat at cafés and wrote poems, read Jeans Ganet and Cocteau, or eavesdropped on conversations he couldn't translate. \"Being in that place where no one looks at me twice and I can't even understand the language was like entering a parallel universe,\" recalls Barnes. \"It was cathartic and inspiring to amputate myself from my normal life and feel like an individual outside of all the baggage and memories.\"\nEnjoying anonymity, he sorted through the inner wreckage left by his divorce two years prior, and took stock of the briefer relationships since. \"my fair lady\" bids adieu to a familiar figure over sax-streaked disco-funk, but we soon meet Sarah from Detroit on darkwave dream \"ambassador bridge,\" and Gabrielle the Athenian Beach Goth amid the trappy space-glitch of \"trashed Exes.\" In \"les chants de maldoror,\" our hero cooly declares, \"We only act nicely when we're ruining hotel beds/I greeted you in a hundred doorways.\" Innocence Reaches continues of Montreal's recent autobiographical streak, which finds Barnes \"fetishizing reality,\" as he puts it.\nBut he's concerned with a broader reality as well. \"it's different for girls\" is an exploration of the \"dilemme féminin\". Combining Daft Punk's aptitude for groove with LCD Soundsystem's wit—an endlessly quotable track that has Barnes outlining the dangers inherent in binary gendering: \"It's different for girls,from when they are children they're de-personalized, aggressively objectified...\" and later Barnes sings \"It's different for girls, they are mercurial creatures, not a masculine dissonance or sexual currency\". The song is less feminine anthem and more pop exegesis of societal codes. \"though some women are demons all of them are God\". Indeed.\nApropos, Innocence Reaches' cover design was an attempt by a new first-time father—Kevin's brother David—to express his \"wonderment for the female anatomy.\" And the aforementioned \"let's relate\" was indeed inspired by trans issues, a subject dear to Barnes' heart. \"I have a history of gender-bending in performances, but that's also always been a part of my identity as a human,\" he says. \"I'm thankful to have an outlet for that, to express that and not get chased out of town or beat up. I think we're moving in the right direction now.\" The song is a call to find common ground in simply being human: \"I like that you like you/I think that you're great/I want to relate,\" he sings cheerily.\nInnocence Reaches features darker moments to be sure—isolation, anger, indifference, and the feeling that, like a Truffaut film, madness lurks just outside the frame—but as Barnes explains, \"Epiphany comes from breakdown. If you can stay open and vulnerable, the nebulous becomes transparent. That's one of the magical aspects of writing from personal life.\"",

Relatively speaking, it’s a modern concept, and adopted by a wealth of fledgling young artist-producers. Who needs a ship-sized mixing desk and an inflated studio budget when you have a trusty Macbook Pro and Fruity Loops to plug into? Yet, typically, it’s already become a term that carries with it similar baggage to the modern-day troubadour. Anxious, nocturnal musicians with a penchant for internet forums has become as reliable a vision as the battered guitar case and finger of whiskey in a backstreet speakeasy. Difficult to shake.",

Athol Brose is the first EP of the band since 2010 and its coterie of female vocalists. Nouvelle Vague and Friends is thus more of a nexus of forthcoming projects: a new album comprised of punk and post punk standards imbued with the inimitable Nouvelle Vague touch and for the first time original songs written by Marc Collin and Olivier Libaux that will create the surprise by demonstrating that the two producers are not as genius arrangers.",

Expect a high energy show that spans Green Day to Grandmaster Flash to Stevie Wonder. The Love Handles first burst onto the underground Dad-core scene at the now infamous Dad Fight Club where they scored the soundtrack for pummeling parents with a 39 minute black metal version of Bowie’s “Heroes.” This dark and confusing gig led the band to soul search through drum circles, scream therapy, rounds of golf, and single malt. In the end they decided to celebrate midlife crisis with party music that makes moms go wild. The kids seem to have taken to the band too, or maybe it’s just the unlimited screen time permitted at their shows.  Take some fatherly advice and squeeze The Love Handles.",

  "artistSummary": "On the night of November 6th, 1979 Black Sabbath was at their most drug addled and explosive standing. They were on tour supporting their newly released Never Say Die album and had a night off in Los Angeles. After knocking back a few drinks at the infamous Rainbow Bar, they decided to check out the local rock scene at the Whiskey A-Go-Go. Arriving late, they caught the tail end of a set by The Circle Jerks. Feeling intimidated yet inspired, they rented a rehearsal space and spent the rest of the night jamming. For an unknown reason they exclusively played Thin Lizzy material and Keith Moon was sitting in… These events never took place. But if they did, the results may have sounded similar to Los Angeles’s . Formed in 2008, The Shrine play a houserocking breed of heavy, psychedelic, riff based Rock n’ Roll. Their debut, recorded on vintage reel-to-reel tape, by local hero Dave O. Jones and under the auspices of the notorious Chuck Dukowski, is the perfect soundtrack to any debaucherous gathering of longhairs. If you and your rag-tag group of riff-raff friends are planning a road trip to Humboldt County to “Score”, this is the album you need to be listening to on the way. The Shrine is Josh Landau on guitar/vocals, Courtland Murphy on bass, and Jeff Murray on Drums. Dig It.",

  "artistSummary": "Acclaimed North Carolina-based band ’s new album, Blindfaller, is out today via Yep Roc Records. The record premiered on The Wall Street Journal and you can read their full interview HERE. No Depression raves, “The voices of Andrew Marlin and Emily Frantz were seemingly destined to make music and beautiful sounds together in harmony…the music they make is nothing short of perfection.” Their single, “Hard Travelin’,” previously premiered via PopMatters, who called the track, “a delightful mix of Americana, bluegrass and country. The new release builds on the acclaim of the band’s breakthrough Yep Roc debut, This Side of Jordan (2013), and last year’s Such Jubilee (2015). The band also begins their extensive full-band fall tour in San Francisco today with stops in Los Angeles, Seattle, Nashville, Chicago, New York and more. See below for tour itinerary with support on select dates from Leif Vollebekk, Anna Tivel, Dead Horses and My Bubba. While staying true to their Americana sound, the new album tackles modern day themes seen in our daily headlines. The North Carolina duo—comprised of Emily Frantz (fiddle/vocals) and Andrew Marlin (mandolin/vocals)—recorded the album in a one week break from touring at Rubber Room Studio in Chapel Hill, NC. “We wanted different vibes and different intuitions on these tracks,” Marlin says, “and I feel like we really captured that.” To bolster their message and sound on Blindfaller the duo added a full band, which features Clint Mullican on bass, Kyle Keegan on drums, Allyn Love on pedal steel, and previous collaborator, Josh Oliver, on guitar, keys, and vocals. Speaking to their recording process Frantz notes, “We talked about the feel of each song and pointed out loosely who was going to be taking solos, but it was mostly a lot of fresh takes, a lot of eye contact and a lot of nods and weird winks.” Founded in 2009, Mandolin Orange has built a noteworthy catalog of recordings. The band’s 2013 release This Side of Jordan garnered critical acclaim such as NPR, who called the album “effortless and beautiful,” and American Songwriter, who said it was “honest music, shot through with coed harmonies, sweeping fiddle, mandolin, acoustic guitar and the sort of unfakeable intimacy that bonds simpatico musicians like Gillian Welch and David Rawlings.” Their 2015 follow-up, Such Jubilee, furthered their standing with inclusion in Rolling Stone’s “30 Great Country Albums of 2015 You Probably Didn’t Hear,” NPR’s Folk Alley’s “Best of 2015 Listener’s Poll,” and Amazon’s “Best of the Next 2015.” The record was #1 on Magnet’s “Top 10 Indie Roots Albums of 2015” and Paste called it “an album full of blissful moments.” On the road, the band has built a dedicated following with extensive touring including appearances at Austin City Limits Festival, Telluride Bluegrass Festival, Newport Folk Festival, and Pickathon. The duo is currently performing select dates this summer before the start of their full-band tour. less…",

  "artistSummary": "No matter how brightly the sun shines, sorrow will always cast its ageless shadow across the human soul. Expressing that eternal sadness is an art in itself, and over the last two decades, Sweden’s masters of melancholy  have firmly established themselves as the most passionate and skilful exponents of the form. Formed by vocalist/drummer Jonas Renkse and guitarist Anders Nyström in Stockholm in 1991, the band emerged from the amorphous maelstrom that was the nascent death/doom metal scene; a darker, more emotionally resonant sibling to the ongoing extreme metal world, and one that offered a new and more humane perspective on life’s darker days. The band’s first releases, the Jhva Elohim Meth…The Revival EP and debut album Dance Of December Souls may have seemed to draw from the same set of influences that inspired like-minded bands across the North Sea like Paradise Lost and My Dying Bride, but by the time Katatonia arrived at 1996’s Brave Murder Day (which featured guest vocals from Opeth’s Mikael Åkerfeldt), the band had already begun to plough their own tearful furrow. “Initially we had no masterplan,” says Renkse today. “All we wanted was a band of our own, as we were totally devoured by the death and doom metal scene that was happening. It wasn’t until later that we could actually carve out our own space and see things with a broader perspective. Katatonia has become a philosophy, at least for ourselves, since it is pretty much all we have. It’s dark and personal music and lyrics, no matter what the environment around us.” In 1998, Katatonia released Discouraged Ones, an album that saw them step away from more traditional doom-laden atmospheres into an increasingly distinctive sonic world. Incorporating a wide variety of influences, from gothic rock to dark folk, the band’s evolution was gathering pace and their songwriting was maturing accordingly. With Jonas Renkse stepping away from the drum stool to focus on his role as vocalist, the Katatonia sound became more focused and intense on 1999’s Tonight’s Decision; a bravura collection of downbeat hymns to the void that set the tone for the new decade that followed. “Most of our evolution has occurred naturally,” explains Renkse. “We started as Paradise Lost fanboys, but now I think we have a different sound, something we have crafted over the years. With every new album we try to push the boundaries of songwriting and expand the concept of Katatonia without abandoning our foundation and roots.” As the 21st century has progressed, Katatonia have become one of the most revered and cherished of all bands in the modern heavy music firmament. Through extensive touring and a steady stream of superlative studio releases, including 2001’s classic Last Fair Deal Gone Down and its coruscating 2003 follow-up Viva Emptiness, the Swedes have spread their baleful gospel across the globe, refining and redefining themselves with every step into new territory. With 2006’s The Great Cold Distance and, in particular, 2009’s universally acclaimed Night Is The New Day, Katatonia have stretched beyond their roots in the metal scene and drawn in fans from all across the musical spectrum, not least in the progressive rock realm that has also embraced peers like Opeth and Anathema in recent times. In August 2012 the band released Dead End Kings, their ninth studio album and their most successful to date. The album marked another step in this journey towards a more progressive sound. Dead End Kings was recorded with a new line-up, in which Renkse and Nyström were joined by guitarist Per Eriksson, bassist Niklas Sandin and drummer Daniel Liljekvist. Together they created a rich, adventurous and endlessly evocative masterwork that exhibits all the Swedish quintet’s established traits while absorbing countless fresh ideas into that monumental sonic brew. “Dead End Kings represents progression and taking things to the next level,” concludes Renkse. ”The writing was a little more intense and spontaneous for this one. I think that’s the biggest difference. But it was made with the same mindset as the last few albums. It just had a little more fire involved. We don’t want to repeat ourselves. We are still hungry for new music.” The band return in September 2013 with Dethroned and Uncrowned, their first album for Kscope, the sister label to Peaceville, the band's home for the past 14 years. Dethroned and Uncrowned allows them to explore the progressive elements of Dead End Kings further as they have reworked the album, creating new moods and textures while still staying truthful to the core of the songs. Guitarist and founding member Anders Nyström explains how the band have revisted the album, ‘the synopsis is simple and album title won’t lie; the drums will be dethroned and the distorted rhythm guitars will be uncrowned! Instead, we’ll place the emphasis on the many layers of ambience, with the melodies staying central and the vocal harmonies representing the heart of the album.' less…",

This rare occasion, together with heavy touring both in Finland and abroad laid the groundwork for Swallow the Sun's skyrocketing success. In September 2006 Swallow the Sun recorded “Hope”, which was released in January of 2007 and impressively hit position #3 on the Official Finnish Album Chart, a feat never before achieved anywhere in the world with a doom album. A year after Swallow the Sun recorded ambitiously “Plague of Butterflies” –EP, which was released by Spinefarm Records in Europe, “Plague of Butterflies” crashed into the Number 1 spot on the Finnish charts in its first week. The EP was released in the US on September 23rd, and was followed by an extensive Finnish and American tour in early 2009.",

They both singed up for a talent show at their local homeschool group with some of their mutual friends and threw together a band called “The Hot List”. After the talent show, the band decided to play covers together for fun. As they got older, Phinehas and Byron started writing original songs together. With the maturity, writing originals became more than just an after school hobby. As things became more serious, the line up changed with it. After a few years of gigging, the band was discovered by Richard Segovia who took them under his wing. After some more line up changes, Phinehas and Byron decided to turn the band into a duo. Currently the two are releasing their debut EP on October 23rd. Phinehas and Byron’s Influences range from various artists such as Kings of Leon, Young the Giant, Bad Suns, The Strokes, Hiatus Kaiyote, John Mayer and many more.",

  "artistSummary": "A shape-shifting Los Angeles-based duo who infuse their breezy, west coast electro-pop with elements of hip-hop, indie rock, and psych-pop, Coast Modern is the brainchild of Seattle native Luke Atlas and L.A.-based Coleman Trapp. The pair met in 2013 as struggling songwriters in the crowded Southern California hitmaking scene. After two years of failing to cast their creations into the mainstream, Trapp retreated to Denver, Colorado to get a little perspective, and began writing songs for himself, rather than the latest tastemaker. He would send theses noodlings back to Atlas, who would add bits of production, and before long, Atlas was back in the City of Angels, and Coast Modern was born. The newly minted duo dropped their first single, \"Hollow Life,\" in 2015, and it drew rave reviews and comparisons to artists like Grouplove, Cage the Elephant, Twenty-One Pilots, and Alt-J. A second single, \"Animals,\" followed in 2016.",

  "artistSummary": "RADIOHEAD are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments), Colin Greenwood (bass), Phil Selway (drums, percussion, backing vocals) and Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals). They have worked with producer Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead released their debut single \"Creep\" in 1992. It became a worldwide hit after the release of the band's debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Their popularity and critical standing rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to international fame; with an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, it is often acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s and one of the best albums of all time. Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a dramatic evolution in Radiohead's style, as they incorporated influences from experimental electronic music, 20th-century classical music, krautrock, and jazz. Despite initially dividing fans and critics, Kid A was later named the best album of the decade by Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of rock and electronic music with lyrics inspired by the War on Terror, was the band's final album for their record label, EMI; their subsequent releases have been self-released. Radiohead released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures. Their ninth album is expected in 2016. Radiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their work places highly in both listener polls and critics' lists of the best music of the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, they were ranked 73rd in Rolling Stone's list of \"The Greatest Artists of All Time\"; Jonny Greenwood (48th) and O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists, and Yorke (66th) in their list of greatest singers. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s.",

The tour announces on the heels of Legend’s fifth studio album Darkness and Light, which has received a plethora of critical praise since its December 2nd release on Columbia Records. USA Today hailed the album as John’s “most personal record” with tracks like “Right By You” which they described as “a heart –tugging rumination on his 7-month old daughter, Luna.” Time Magazine called the body of work “unflappably classy” while the New York Times said Legend “treats love as something far more complex than a panacea and a fount of perpetual reassurance, with music to match.” Continuing, the New York Times pointed to the album’s most recent anthemic hit single, “Love Me Now”, which they praised as “a seize the moment song”, that “revolves around an insistent, lo-fi piano figure, and its chorus first arrives with Mr. Legend nearly alone, singing over simple, fading chords”.\nLegend also continues his successful foray into the world of film as one of the principles for production company Get Lifted Film Co., which has an executive producing credit on the 14-time Oscar-nominated film La La Land in which John also appears, playing a jazz band leader named Keith alongside stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Legend also contributed to the film’s soundtrack with the original song “Start a Fire.” To date, La La Land has taken home an impressive six Golden Globe Awards, two SAG Awards and a PGA Award.",

  "artistSummary": "Since 1997, San Francisco’s  have recorded four best-selling albums and assembled one career retrospective. 3EB recently released “We Are Drugs. “ Led by Stephan Jenkins, 3EB won wide success during a tumultuous group of years when the major-label recording industry was finally losing its grip on an enterprise that for decades it had dominated with steely efficiency. Nothing could have made 3EB happier! 3EB, however, have experienced no comparable loss. Instead, they have gained artistic clarification — and, surprisingly, a fan base who is larger, younger and more dedicated than ever. Participation in the older, untouchable realm of nervous star-making could color a band’s identity. In the case of 3EB, it often blurred the perception of their brilliant musical creations. In recent years, those creations have recast the band among a current generation of fans. 3EB now write, tour, record, and communicate in a fluid new world where their music continues naturally to evolve. Their exchange with their audience is unfiltered and being from the hub of tech, they are using it to develop a closer exchange with their audience. After a stunning festival run in 2016 with appearances at Lollapalooza, Outside Lands, Bumbershoot, Bonnaroo and many others, they are poised for a fantastic 20th Anniversary celebration in 2017 with new material to be released.",

The track premiered today on Rollingstone.com. The highly anticipated new material accompanies the film, The Smog Of The Sea, a documentary that provides a new perspective on the once pristine oceans of the world, while making an artful call to action for rethinking single-use plastic. The Smog Of The Sea is available to stream starting today via, www.smogofthesea.com.\nCurbing the use of single-use plastic has been at the forefront of Johnson’s work for over a decade. Since 2005, Johnson’s crew has implemented a plastic free backstage and since 2007 all shows have offered fans free water through water-refill stations. In 2014, Johnson successfully helped launch a Reusable Pint Program at the Santa Barbara Bowl, which has since inspired venues across the country to follow suit, including the Les Schwab Amphitheatre in Bend, OR, and all venues owned by Live Nation. This summer, more venues will adopt a Reusable Pint Program, which provides fans with an alternative to disposable plastic cups. Fans who purchase this reusable stainless steel cup at venue concessions will receive a discount on all beverage refill purchases for the life of the cup.\nIn addition to these plastic free initiatives, Johnson and his production team, alongside Reverb, will continue to pave the way in green touring practices with extensive sustainability programs at every show. On the 2017 tour, additional greening actions include sourcing sustainable biodiesel for tour vehicles, producing up-cycled and eco-friendly merchandise, and expanding waste reduction, composting and recycling. The tour will also source local, organic food as part of a “farm to stage” program, offer bike valets and alternative transportation incentives, as well as offset all remaining CO2 emissions. Through Johnson’s All At Once campaign, the summer tour will support over 140 non-profit partners and will engage fans to take action in support of sustainable local food systems and plastic free initiatives. Fans can visit these partners in the Village Green and participate in the greening actions at each show and win a chance to watch Johnson’s set from the Best Seats in the House….the stage!

There’s a bittersweet, romantic sensibility present. The overall feeling is lost love, or perhaps love never found, yet Mac embraces this without making it an overly somber experience for the listener. It’s at times haunting and warm, and a bit more refined and sophisticated, but still plenty playful, retaining the guts and soul of classic Mac.",

  "artistSummary": "Jackie Greene\n\"We live in such a fast-paced, hectic environment, I wanted to make a record that would invite people to step back and take their time to listen,\" Jackie Greene says of Back to Birth, his first album in five years. \"I wanted to make a record that would reward people who are willing to sit down and give it a couple of serious listens.\"\n\nBack to Birth - Greene's seventh album and his Yep Roc Records debut - is more than worthy of some serious attention. The 11-song set showcases the multitalented artist's uncanny knack for synthesizing his deep affinity for American roots styles into timeless, personally-charged music. Armed with a persuasive voice, a vivid songwriting skill and an instinctive mastery of several instruments, Greene has carved out a unique musical niche, and the album marks another creative landmark in his already compelling body of work.\n\nProduced by Los Lobos member and frequent Greene collaborator Steve Berlin, Back to Birth underlines Greene's remarkable evolution as a performer and writer. With such new compositions as \"Silver Lining,\" \"Trust Somebody,\" \"Now I Can See For Miles,\" and the stirring title track, the artist's distinctive melodic sensibility is matched with thoughtful, introspective lyrics that confront some profound philosophical issues with plainspoken eloquence.\n\n\"Musically, this album is kind of a return to the simplicity of the records that I started with, although I feel like I have a much better idea of what I'm doing now,\" Greene observes. \"I think the lyrics are the part that have really evolved. A lot of these songs explore the notion of a cyclical existence, and the sense that life goes in a circle. I want the songs to come from a place that's meaningful to me, but I also want to keep them as simple and direct as I can. I look at old blues songs, or Hank Williams songs, and they're so simple and direct but they can convey some pretty deep ideas.\"\n\nAlthough Back to Birth is Greene's first new solo release in five years, he's hardly been idle. In fact, he's spent much of the past few years engaging in a series of collaborative musical adventures that have teamed him with several notable veterans.\n\nIn 2013, Greene joined the reunited Black Crowes as lead guitarist on their worldwide tour, and the following year released the self-titled debut album of supergroup Trigger Hippy, which Greene is a member of along with Joan Osborne and Crowes drummer Steve Gorman. Greene continues to be a frequent member of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh’s touring ensemble Phil Lesh & Friends, for which he has contributed lead guitar and vocals since 2007. Greene also toured as part of WRG, an acoustic trio with the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson, and he performed with Levon Helm as part of Helm's fabled Midnight Ramble shows.\n\nThe same qualities that attracted such legendary figures to work with Greene are prominent throughout Back to Birth, which Greene and producer Berlin cut at Portland's Supernatural Sound with a sympathetic crew of mostly jazz-steeped players, with Greene stretching out on a number of instruments, including guitar, piano, organ and drums.\n\n\"This is the third album I've done with Steve,\" he says. \"I've known him for about 12 years, and he's really good at challenging me and getting it out of me. We know each other well enough at this point that we can be blunt with each other, and he'll tell me that I'm full of it if that's what I need to hear.\"\n\nThe musical passion and creative integrity that drive Back to Birth have been constants in Jackie Greene's musical life from the start. While growing up in Northern California, he taught himself to play piano and guitar. His musical reference points shifted radically when, at the age of 14, he ran across a cache of his parents' vintage rock, country, blues and R&B LPs in the family's basement.\n\nStill in his teens and inspired by his discoveries, Greene began writing songs and performing them at a local coffeehouse while recording his compositions in his makeshift garage studio and burning CDRs to sell at his gigs. He saved the money he made selling those discs to fund his debut album, the self-produced, self-released Rusty Nails. Despite being a D.I.Y. release with minimal promotion, the disc received substantial regional attention from fans and press alike.\n\nHis popularity led to a deal with a local independent label, which released his second album, Gone Wanderin', in late 2002. The disc won considerable national attention, leading to a series of national tours opening for the likes of B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Susan Tedeschi, Huey Lewis, Mark Knopfler and Taj Mahal.\n\nGreene continued to win critical acclaim and expand his fan base with 2004's Sweet Somewhere Bound and 2006's American Myth. In 2007, Greene began moonlighting with Phil Lesh and Friends, while continuing his own musical evolution with his own releases Giving Up the Ghost and Till the Light Comes, released in 2008 and 2010, respectively.\n\n\"The musicians that I really admire and try to emulate are the ones who have the whole package: they're great songwriters, great singers and great instrumentalists, and they have a vibe about them that's real,\" he states, adding, \"When I go to make a record, I'm not thinking about where I can fit in a bunch of guitar solos. I'm thinking, 'What does this song feel like? What's it saying?' So my goal, when writing a song or making a record, is to find the core of that emotional experience and convey that.\"\n\nAlthough he's already racked up a multitude of impressive musical achievements, Greene isn't one to look back. Instead, he continues to look to the future - and looks forward to getting back on the road to bring Back to Birth's soulful songcraft to the loyal, wildly diverse fan base that he's built through talent, vision and hard work.\n\n\"I still plan on making a lot of different kinds of records in the future, but I can't tell you what they're going to sound like, because I really have no idea,\" he asserts. \"All I can do is write songs and make music as honestly as I can. That's what I believe people appreciate about what I do. They trust me to be honest with them, and I'd never want to abuse that trust.\"",

  "artistSummary": "Jackie Greene\n\"We live in such a fast-paced, hectic environment, I wanted to make a record that would invite people to step back and take their time to listen,\" Jackie Greene says of Back to Birth, his first album in five years. \"I wanted to make a record that would reward people who are willing to sit down and give it a couple of serious listens.\"\n\nBack to Birth - Greene's seventh album and his Yep Roc Records debut - is more than worthy of some serious attention. The 11-song set showcases the multitalented artist's uncanny knack for synthesizing his deep affinity for American roots styles into timeless, personally-charged music. Armed with a persuasive voice, a vivid songwriting skill and an instinctive mastery of several instruments, Greene has carved out a unique musical niche, and the album marks another creative landmark in his already compelling body of work.\n\nProduced by Los Lobos member and frequent Greene collaborator Steve Berlin, Back to Birth underlines Greene's remarkable evolution as a performer and writer. With such new compositions as \"Silver Lining,\" \"Trust Somebody,\" \"Now I Can See For Miles,\" and the stirring title track, the artist's distinctive melodic sensibility is matched with thoughtful, introspective lyrics that confront some profound philosophical issues with plainspoken eloquence.\n\n\"Musically, this album is kind of a return to the simplicity of the records that I started with, although I feel like I have a much better idea of what I'm doing now,\" Greene observes. \"I think the lyrics are the part that have really evolved. A lot of these songs explore the notion of a cyclical existence, and the sense that life goes in a circle. I want the songs to come from a place that's meaningful to me, but I also want to keep them as simple and direct as I can. I look at old blues songs, or Hank Williams songs, and they're so simple and direct but they can convey some pretty deep ideas.\"\n\nAlthough Back to Birth is Greene's first new solo release in five years, he's hardly been idle. In fact, he's spent much of the past few years engaging in a series of collaborative musical adventures that have teamed him with several notable veterans.\n\nIn 2013, Greene joined the reunited Black Crowes as lead guitarist on their worldwide tour, and the following year released the self-titled debut album of supergroup Trigger Hippy, which Greene is a member of along with Joan Osborne and Crowes drummer Steve Gorman. Greene continues to be a frequent member of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh’s touring ensemble Phil Lesh & Friends, for which he has contributed lead guitar and vocals since 2007. Greene also toured as part of WRG, an acoustic trio with the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson, and he performed with Levon Helm as part of Helm's fabled Midnight Ramble shows.\n\nThe same qualities that attracted such legendary figures to work with Greene are prominent throughout Back to Birth, which Greene and producer Berlin cut at Portland's Supernatural Sound with a sympathetic crew of mostly jazz-steeped players, with Greene stretching out on a number of instruments, including guitar, piano, organ and drums.\n\n\"This is the third album I've done with Steve,\" he says. \"I've known him for about 12 years, and he's really good at challenging me and getting it out of me. We know each other well enough at this point that we can be blunt with each other, and he'll tell me that I'm full of it if that's what I need to hear.\"\n\nThe musical passion and creative integrity that drive Back to Birth have been constants in Jackie Greene's musical life from the start. While growing up in Northern California, he taught himself to play piano and guitar. His musical reference points shifted radically when, at the age of 14, he ran across a cache of his parents' vintage rock, country, blues and R&B LPs in the family's basement.\n\nStill in his teens and inspired by his discoveries, Greene began writing songs and performing them at a local coffeehouse while recording his compositions in his makeshift garage studio and burning CDRs to sell at his gigs. He saved the money he made selling those discs to fund his debut album, the self-produced, self-released Rusty Nails. Despite being a D.I.Y. release with minimal promotion, the disc received substantial regional attention from fans and press alike.\n\nHis popularity led to a deal with a local independent label, which released his second album, Gone Wanderin', in late 2002. The disc won considerable national attention, leading to a series of national tours opening for the likes of B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Susan Tedeschi, Huey Lewis, Mark Knopfler and Taj Mahal.\n\nGreene continued to win critical acclaim and expand his fan base with 2004's Sweet Somewhere Bound and 2006's American Myth. In 2007, Greene began moonlighting with Phil Lesh and Friends, while continuing his own musical evolution with his own releases Giving Up the Ghost and Till the Light Comes, released in 2008 and 2010, respectively.\n\n\"The musicians that I really admire and try to emulate are the ones who have the whole package: they're great songwriters, great singers and great instrumentalists, and they have a vibe about them that's real,\" he states, adding, \"When I go to make a record, I'm not thinking about where I can fit in a bunch of guitar solos. I'm thinking, 'What does this song feel like? What's it saying?' So my goal, when writing a song or making a record, is to find the core of that emotional experience and convey that.\"\n\nAlthough he's already racked up a multitude of impressive musical achievements, Greene isn't one to look back. Instead, he continues to look to the future - and looks forward to getting back on the road to bring Back to Birth's soulful songcraft to the loyal, wildly diverse fan base that he's built through talent, vision and hard work.\n\n\"I still plan on making a lot of different kinds of records in the future, but I can't tell you what they're going to sound like, because I really have no idea,\" he asserts. \"All I can do is write songs and make music as honestly as I can. That's what I believe people appreciate about what I do. They trust me to be honest with them, and I'd never want to abuse that trust.\"",

  "artistSummary": "Jerry Joseph\nFor more than 30 years, Jerry Joseph has been strapping on a guitar and chasing down truth, understanding and soul with a tenacity and resonant skill that mark him as a hard charging kindred spirit to Joe Strummer, Warren Zevon and Patti Smith. While not a household name or critic's darling, Joseph is the archetypal musician's musician, something resoundingly clear in his live performances, as well as his studio work. \n\nJoseph's current foursome, the Jackmormons, is the latest chapter in his long, strange musical journey that flows like glowing quicksilver through the modern psyche, where war and disaster wrestle with hope and faith. The Jackmormons currently feature Joseph (guitar, lead vocals), Steve Drizos (drums, backing vocals), Steve James Wright (bass, backing vocals) and Jeff Crosby (guitar, vocals). \n\nJoseph first came to prominence in the mid-1980s with still-beloved cult band Little Women, a reggae-rock proto-jam band that dominated the Rocky Mountain club scene for nearly a decade, and notably helped break jam giants Widespread Panic, who looked up to Joseph and opened for his band before rising to prominence. In fact, Joseph wrote many of Panic's favorite concert staples, including such blazing epics as North, Chainsaw City and Climb to Safety. \n\nSteve Drizos and Steve James Wright are also musical lifers working steadily for decades both as sparring partners to Jerry Joseph and elsewhere. Drizos was a member of acoustic Dexter Grove from 1995-2004, a band that performed over 1,500 shows nationally. Drizos produced the live Jackmormons record Badlandia and co-produced Happy Book, as well as performing and recording with such luminaries as Dave Mason and Jim Capaldi (of Traffic), Widespread Panic, The Decemberists, moe., Merle Saunders, Eric McFadden, and dozens of local Portland artists. \n\nSteve James Wright has been a complement to Joseph since almost Day One, as the guitarist for Little Women and an outstanding player in his own right. After taking some time off, James graciously and expertly moved over to bass to bring back a slinkier, funkier and more psychedelic mood to the Jackmormons sound. His deep knowledge of the material and his more melodic style now combine to challenge the band to find its finest grooves.\n\nThe more recent addition of young stud guitar player/singer/songwriter Jeff Crosby (Jeff Crosby & The Refugees) has proved another prescient move by Joseph. A couple of Crosby’s songs from the 2013 album, Silent Conversations, were featured on the hit FX series, Sons of Anarchy. Crosby helps brings out the Americana sensibility of the Jackmormons sound, and his crisp guitar work proves an admirable counterpart to Joseph’s open-minded approach. And a Crosby tune or 2 has become a welcome part of a Jackmormons’ set.\n\nJoseph’s influences are many and varied. “Columbia Record Club used to have 20 records for a penny and I filled out form after form, and these boxes of records came to my house and my parents would flip out. Those were my influences,” says Joseph. “I was a kid, so I was as into The Monkees as I was The Beatles. Then, my mother would tell you, it was all over on my 9th or 10th birthday with [Black Sabbath's] Master of Reality and Steppenwolf Live. Then at 12, it was jazz. I saw every jazz act that toured in the 70s…Herbie Hancock and Tower of Power after we went to see Steely Dan. All that and then my older babysitter bought me Exile on Main Street and I saw [Bob Marley and] The Wailers in 1976 and moved to New Zealand. And then The Clash came out and changed my life. But I also loved ZZ Top and all those guitar bands. When I lived in New Zealand, I sat in my window and read Lord of the Rings while listening to prog like Gentle Giant and Camel. Later, I learned a lot from Chris Whitley touring around Europe with him.”\n\nMeanwhile, Joseph is steadily extending his global reach, taking advantage of the Internet's ability to find audiences worldwide with tours in Southeast Asia, Europe, Central America, Israel, Lebanon, Ireland, England and elsewhere. Joseph is a hyper-gifted American singer-songwriter finding appreciation beyond his own country's borders, an endlessly insightful rabble-rouser and back street shaman. His creative tendrils extend beyond the Jackmormons into everything from extensive solo work to rangy rock juggernaut Stockholm Syndrome (where Joseph plays with Widespread Panic's Dave Schools, Bay Area guitar marvel Eric McFadden, Gov't Mule's Danny Louis, and percussionist Wally Ingram), and a host of unreleased work.\n\nDespite the sort of roadblocks and turns of fortune that usually crush most musicians, Joseph survives, and in fact, thrives in a way that's heartening and stirring, as anyone who has seen a live show can testify.\n\n“I'm lucky. I work. I've never had to play in a cover band. I've never had to wear a funny hat, “ says Joseph. “Perhaps because of the lack of traditional success, I've put out about a record a year, plus all the stuff that's never come out, and it's kept me creatively honest. I don't rehash my past. I don't repeat any of my old hits because I don't have any big hits.”",

  "artistSummary": "Since moving to Los Angeles from her native Guatemala, singer-songwriter Gaby Moreno has achieved remarkable success as a musician. She has been nominated for an Emmy and won a Latin Grammy for Best New Artist. She has released four albums, toured with singers Tracy Chapman, Ani DiFranco, Punch Brothers, Hugh Laurie and Calexico, and has shared the international stage with pop music luminaries such as Bono, Andrea Boccelli and Van Dyke Parks.\n\nIn 2006, her song, “Escondidos,” took the top prize in the John Lennon Songwriting Contest, the first contestant in the Latin category to win Song of the Year. (She’s now a judge.) That opened many more doors. Her first album, “Still the Unknown” , produced independently was released in 2008.\n\nMoreno’s career started moving quickly. She co-wrote the theme song of the television series “Parks and Recreation,” which was nominated for an Emmy in 2010. That same year, she recorded the classic song “Smile,” by Charlie Chaplin, for the Oscar-winning documentary “The Cove.” And she performed “Toast to Freedom,” a song commemorating the 50th anniversary of Amnesty International, first with Kris Kristofferson on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, then in Dublin where she shared the stage with Angelique Kidjo and Bono.\n\nShe released her second album, “Illustrated Songs” in 2011, followed by “Postales.” in 2012, her first release entirely in Spanish and with Metamorfosis, the label founded by her compatriot Ricardo Arjona, one of Latin America’s most prominent singer-songwriters. . That year, Moreno and Arjona released a duet, “Fuiste Tu,” which was nominated for Song of the Year and Record of the Year in the 13th Annual Latin Grammy Awards.\n\nBy the time Moreno was named Best New Artist in the 14th annual Latin Grammy Awards of 2013, the “newcomer” had already almost spent half her life in the music business.\n\nWhen it came time to record her latest album, “Ilusión” (due for release September 9th), Moreno decided it was time to harken back to beginnings. Musically, the new album captures the pure spirit of the aspiring immigrant artist who made her way in a new country with just her guitar, her gifted voice, and a pocketful of songs she was eager to share.\n\n“I wanted the record to sound as authentic and as close as possible to what the band sounds live,” she says, referring to her longtime collaborators. “I said, ‘Okay, let’s go back to the sound when I put out my first album, when it was just a few musicians in a room together, and it was about having fun and capturing performances. I wanted something human. I’m not a robot. I wanted to embrace the imperfections. That’s human. Maybe in the moment, I’m feeling something that’s making my voice break. It’s raw emotion. I wanted to keep that.\"\n\nAnd she succeeded. The new collection of 13 songs, most of which she wrote or co-wrote, reflect the organic mixture of her wide array of influences, from the blues to boleros. The record’s natural sound reflects the analog philosophy of producer Gabe Roth, co-founder of Brooklyn-based Daptone Records, the independent label specializing in what it calls the “New Sound of Old Soul.”\n\nThat’s a slogan that happens to suit the singer to a tee. \n\n“I don’t want to sound like an old record, but there’s something about those old records that I love, especially that warm sound,” says Moreno. “This is why I wanted to go into the studio for this new record with Gabe Roth. Because of his minimalist approach. He doesn’t use any computers, it’s all his ears. We did it all to tape, using these beautiful old vintage microphones, and playing all together in the same room. So you don’t have the luxury of doing 20 takes for every song. We do three takes and choose the best one out of the three. It was kind of nerve-racking... but it sounds so real.”\n\nThe album includes separate Spanish and English versions of the first single, “Se Apagó/Love Is Gone,” a song of heartbreak with a twangy guitar, a bright brass section and a feel of Southern soul. Nashville-based R&B singer Jonny P joins her on their English duet, a couple’s dialog.\n\nMoreno’s uplifting, hymn-like “Fronteras,” which means borders, reveals a theme of hope in the midst of darkness. In a time of persecution of immigrants, the song extends a hand of camaraderie for those who leave everything behind to pursue their dreams. The bilingual refrain captures the essence of “Ilusión” and the composer’s confident, mature state of mind when she created it: “And I laugh and dance. It’s in my blood. And I dream free. This is where I belong.”",

Skhy; He first performed with Garcia at the weekly jam sessions with bassist John Kahn and drummer Bill Vitt at the Bay Area club the Matrix, and in 1970 played on the Dead's seminal American Beauty LP. Hooteroll?, the first joint Wales/Garcia album, appeared in 1971; the duo also teamed with guitarist Jim Vincent and bassist Roger Troy for a tour of the Northeast in 1972. This period also saw Howard working with guitarist Harvey Mandel appearing on Mandel's, fiery jazz-influenced, blues-based rock classic, \"Baby Batter\" album. Howard's own album, Rendezvous with The Sun, from in 1976 remains a seminal underground opus of acid jazz rock fusion constantly in demand among music collectors.

Wild Child performs internationally, playing to packed venues around the globe.\n\nFront man, Dave Brock, started his role as the Lizard King by grabbing the lead in the\" Jim Morrison Rock Opera,\" produced by the late legends sister, Anna Morrison Graham. Anna personally selected Brock for the part. From there, he started the band \"Wild Child,\" whose reputation rapidly spread from Southern California to remote areas of the world. Wild Child's first show at The Whisky a-Go-Go was on July 3rd, 1986. A long string of sell out shows at The Whisky has continued for Wild Child to this date. Wild Child broke right into the national act venue circuit, and continues to play across the country and abroad to packed touring act venues. Many experts have complimented Wild Child's rendition of a Doors concert, some of which are listed on the Press page of this site. Concert goers leave Wild Child concerts in amazement and disbelief, many of which are quoted here at Fan Reviews. The band relies on stage craft and musicianship to create an event that people will remember, without corn ball antics and pretentious banter. This is a serious, touring re-creation stage show!\n\nTwo years ago the band produced \"Wild Child - Live In Concert\" a 22 song double disc CD set of songs that The Doors made popular on stage as well as songs from their last album that they were never able to perform live with Jim Morrison, due to his unexpected death. Recorded 100% live, this CD set can be purchased and MP3 clips can be heard on the Wild Child live double CD page of this site. Below is what one expert said about the CD set :\n\n… [Wild Child's live CD] has been in production for over a year as lead singer David Brock has sought perfection on each and every song. I honestly think that this recording could get passed off to even a seasoned collector as being a new unheard Doors live show from the 1960's. It's the most incredible re-creation that I have ever heard\"",

  "artistSummary": "Instruments:\n\nBen “Smiley” Silverstein (keys), Maximillian Newman (guitar), Corey Frye (vocals), Rob Walker (bass), and Reuben Gringrich (drums)\n\nBio:\n\nThe Main Squeeze, with deep musical roots sprouted in the Midwest, have scored their lives at each twist and curve. While starting out as a party band at Indiana University, their forthcoming April 28th release “Without a Sound” illustrates their increasing musical maturity and creativity inspired by their new home in Los Angeles. \n\nIf maturity comes with experience, “Without a Sound” reflects this. The Main Squeeze has spent several years building their foundation since being championed by producer Randy Jackson: they have played Red Rocks; shared the stage with The Roots, Aloe Blacc, Janes Addiction, Umphrey’s McGee, and Trombone Shorty; and performed at music festivals like Bonnaroo, Electric Forest, Summer Camp, and High Sierra. \n\nThe Main Squeeze is a blend of soul and hip-hop, funk with rock. They know their sound is “soulful, powerful, and unique” (Newman). Rolling Stone agrees in their recent critique of a live show: “Lead singer Corey Frye’s powerfully soulful vocals forms the foundation of an energetic set.” \n\nThese underpinnings are important yet The Main Squeeze’s true focus will always be to “strive to reach people” through their beat loving heart in their music. “We are devoted to making great music for people to get lost in and to feel real emotion and love, and also to dance and enjoy life. And it's only just the beginning” (Newman). Billboard believes they have touched on this goal: “Funk runs deep in their DNA. Dare you not to two-step.”\n\nThe beats on “Without A Sound” are plentiful and it is balanced with emotion, a mix of vocals, and instrumentation of the band. Their vibe is simultaneously timeless and futuristic as they are inspired by the greats, yet have found a way to infuse their own genius into the mix. \n\nThe Main Squeeze appeals to your head, heart and body.",

  "artistSummary": "Gaelynn Lea All the Roads that Lead Us Home & The Songs We Sing Along the Way\n\nGaelynn Lea is a musician from Duluth, MN. She has been playing violin for over twenty years. First classically trained, she began learning traditional Celtic and American fiddle tunes at the age of 18. During her college years Gaelynn started sitting in with various folk/rock musicians and developed an improvisational style all her own. Eventually she also began singing and dabbling in songwriting. Gaelynn has played alongside many notable Minnesota musicians over the years, including Alan Sparhawk, Charlie Parr, and Billy McLaughlin. \n\nGaelynn Lea has been actively performing throughout Northern Minnesota and Wisconsin since 2006, contributing to a number of musical projects in the Twin Ports. Currently her most active collaboration is The Murder of Crows, an atmospheric alternative duo with Alan Sparhawk. Together they recorded an EP titled \"Imperfecta\" in 2012. Their original song \"When We Were Young\" was featured on the Sundance Channel's acclaimed drama \"Rectify\" in June 2014. Gaelynn also regularly performs solo sets of experimental fiddle tunes sprinkled with her original songs; her aim is to create a meditative, layered sound that allows the listener's mind to drift. \n\nIn November 2015, Gaelynn Lea released her debut solo album entitled \"All the Roads that Lead Us Home\". It pays homage to the traditional fiddle tunes and beloved standards that Gaelynn has been playing for over a decade… But of course, there is a twist! Gaelynn used her Memory Man looping pedal to create winding layers of sound underneath these familiar melodies. \n\nFrom her album review by Tony Bennett in the Duluth News Tribune: \n\n\"Lea takes a meditative approach, building loops that are based on sustained notes and vibrato, loops that seem like she's scoring a sunrise on a winter morning. Yearning, reaching melodies emerge from the wash of sound and then recede into the background. Chords are flittingly outlined as root notes collide with thirds or fifths or sevenths. It's all very ephemeral and gauzy, and the tracks are easy to get lost in. All the Roads that Lead Us Home is a focused, vibrant piece of music by a person who is able to take a solitary instrument and make it sound like a full string arrangement, who can fill a full-length LP with mostly just those sounds and communicate fluently her heart and soul with only a few tools.\" \n\nOn March 3, 2016, Gaelynn Lea was named the winner of NPR Music's second-ever Tiny Desk Contest. Her music video entry rose to the top of over 6,100 entries from around the nation, chosen as the unanimous favorite among the contest's six judges. The very next week, Gaelynn performed a moving Tiny Desk Concert, at which the show's host Bob Boilen said \"there was hardly a dry eye.\" \n\nA handful of busy months flew by after winning NPR Music's Tiny Desk Contest, and somewhere in that whirlwind Gaelynn managed to record a 6-track EP titled \"The Songs \n\nWe Sing Along the Way\". This record was released on August 15th, 2016 and is a blend of Lea's original songs (including the contest-winning number, \"Someday We'll Linger in the Sun\"), traditional fiddle tunes, and her own poetry. \n\nLea identifies equally as a songwriter and a fiddler, so much like her debut solo album, Gaelynn constructed this EP to be a winding exploration of both art forms. However this time around she took a slightly different approach, choosing to collaborate with Minneapolis songwriter, guitarist and percussionist Alan Church (BBGUN, Al Church and State). He skillfully added texture and color to each track as they improvised together in The Pearl Recording Studio in the Twin Cities. Gaelynn Lea hopes this EP will provide her new, wider audience with a sense hope and an appreciation of what the violin can do and has done for hundreds of years. \n\nIn addition to performing and recording, Gaelynn loves to do speaking engagements about disability, overcoming challenges, and the joy of music. Gaelynn has a congenital disability called Osteogenesis Imperfecta, or Brittle Bones Disease. In recent years, she has used her music as a platform to advocate for people with disabilities and to promote positive social change. Gaelynn believes society must make accessibility a priority so people with disabilities can participate fully in their communities and use their talents and gifts without discrimination. \n\nQuotes:\n\n\"Karen Dalton and Joanna Newsom melt together in the form of Gaelynn Lea and set about absolutely obliterating your heart.\" -Dan Auerbach (The Black Keys)\n\n\"The way her voice resonates is so unusual and beautiful, like nothing I've ever heard before.\" -Jess Wolfe (Lucius)",

  "artistSummary": "The Sextones\nThe Sextones are a family of music renegades known for viciously executed soul compositions and white-knuckle driving funk. Fronted by the charismatic and soulful vocalist Mark Sexton - The Sextones’ sound is a tip of the hat to the days of Tower of Power and Stevie Wonder while actively forging the path for a new generation of soul and funk. Based in the wild desert of Reno, NV, The Sextones continue to diligently craft their distinctive brand of soul with face-melting guitar parts, intricate bass-work, commanding drum rhythms, sticky Hammond B3 comping, brutally honest and heartfelt vocal acrobatics and a fearless and exciting stage performance.\n\nIn 2014 the original trio of Mark Sexton, bassist Alexander Korostinsky and drummer Daniel Weiss employed the talents of keyboard virtuoso Ryan Taylor to complete their musical family. Over the last 10 years, these young soul renegades have relentlessly toured the west coast gaining a multifarious group of loyal fans that help turn every show into an all-out funk dance party. The future has continued to get brighter for The Sextones as they have shared the stage with music heavyweights, Macy Gray, Charles Bradley, Dumpstaphunk, and their idols are starting to take notice. Festival appearances have included Railroad Earth’s Hangtown Halloween Ball, Wanderlust and Brews Jazz & Funk Fest just to name a few. The release of their debut album later in 2016 will include a national tour and more regional support tours.\n\nFormally known as Mark Sexton Band, their 2013 release, Young & Naïve, was mixed by none other than legendary drummer Alan Evans of Soulive. “It sounded great even before I got my hands on it”, explains Alan Evans, “that’s what happens when you get great players playing great songs.” The album was recorded in Los Angeles by Emmy Award winning engineer Larold Rebhun. The group’s new album \"Moonlight Vision\" was recorded at Prairie Sun Studios in Northern California and is set for release in April 20",

  "artistSummary": "Greetings, music lovers. Allow us to draw attention to the new slab by the emminent and hirsute Steeltown reprobate, Lee Harvey Osmond, aka Tom Wilson aka One of Three Rodeo Kings aka that large, melodic growling man from the former Junkhouse. This record is called “Beautiful Scars,” as in: “Man, that scar is beautiful,” or “She has a beautiful scar right here…” or “My scar is beautiful. It reminds me of that time I didn’t die.” The humanity of the album– produced by Michael Timmins in the intimacy of his Toronto Roncesvalles studio– is like the warmth of blood that rushes to the cut: a sudden jolt in the middle of peril and uncertainty; a suspension of possibility that anything can happen next. Redolent with swooning horns and guitars that bob and weave, LHO’s voice– forever the hallmark of his sound, which spans over three decades of work– sounds, here, like a warm hand to the forehead, an arm on the arm of the stricken, a comforting growl at the heart of a screaming world. At once evoking Howlin’ Wolf, Mike Scott and Roy Loney, “Beautiful Scars” bends and twists and stretches and squeezes LHO’s deep baritone, the producer treating it as if caged in a transistor radio, bathed in echo from above, or sunk in the muck of distortion. The strength of the songs notwithstanding, “Beautiful Scars” is a fascinating vocal journey to rank among the great sonic Canadian records of our time.\n\nThrough the truncheon swing of “Loser for your Love” to the haunting balladry of “Come and Go” to the morose beauty of “Burning in My Bed” to the exotic fusion of the album’s penultimate track, “Black Spruce,” “Beautiful Scars” journeys between the quiet, smouldering, raging, moving and sad. Lyrically, LHO reflects on the mistakes of the singer’s past with the resigned perspective of someone coming through the other side. A song like “Hey, Hey, Hey”– featuring a thrilling slide guitar piece by Aaron Goldstein– describes two lovers caught in the throes of personal despair, their “dreams turned to rust,” their lives waiting until “the morning comes and sweeps us both away.” LHO sings: “The world is fucked up. And so are you and I.” It defines an album, and a songwriter, bereft of any choices other than to keep moving for fear of sinking into the mire of a dark past.\n\nThis is the 3rd solo album from the Hamilton songwriter– the progenitor of “Acid Folk,”– whose previous two albums, “A Quiet Evil” and “The Folk Sinner” were previously long-listed for the Polaris Prize and nominated for a Juno. It’s a dynamic footprint on Canada’s song-scape, a deeply personal, but universally affecting, journey across the jagged line of scars and smoothness of skin that surrounds them.",

  "artistSummary": "Now celebrating its 20th year, Sexmob (Steven Bernstein - slide trumpet, Briggan Krauss - saxophones, Tony Scherr - bass, Kenny Wollesen - drums) continues to deconstruct familiar pop tunes with subversive impunity. Everything from Prince’s “Sign O’ the Times” to John Barry’s “Goldfinger,” the Grateful Dead’s “Ripple,” Nirvana’s “About a Girl,” the Rolling Stones’ “Ruby Tuesday,” Buffalo Springfield’s “For What It’s Worth,” Paul McCartney’s “Live and Let Die” and ABBA’s “Fernando” is fair game for this band of musical renegades. And Bernstein is explicit about Sexmob not being a cover band. ”Covers to me means you play it exactly like the record,” he explains. “I just take songs that I feel have a great melody and do them in my style. So I’ll pick a tune and tell the guys, ‘Let’s Sexmob this!’ And I realize that's what jazz musicians have always done. That’s how Lester Young and Charlie Parker and Miles Davis got popular. They played the songs that everyone knew. And because they could recognize the song then that invited them into their style.\" \n\nThe fact that Bernstein exclusively plays slide trumpet in Sexmob gives the quartet an even more distinctive edge. As he puts it, “When you play the trumpet, Louis Armstrong is the king. But when I play the slide trumpet, I’m the king. It’s my voice. On trumpet, there’s no escaping Armstrong and Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Freddie Hubbard, Woody Shaw, Lester Bowie…all those cats. But on slide trumpet, it’s just me.”\n\nSexmob came together in 1996 in a weekly residency at the Knitting Factory Tap Room and in 1998 released its debut, Din of Inequity. They followed with 2000’s Solid Sender, 2001’s Sex Mob Does Bond, 2003’s Dime Grind Palace, 2006’s Sexotica, 2009’s Sex Mob Meets Medeski: Live in Willisau and 2013’s Cinema, Circus & Spaghetti: Sex Mob Plays Fellini. The group’s latest, Cultural Capital, is the first Sexmob recording to feature all Bernstein original compositions. “Some of them, like ‘Bari Si,’ ‘Step Apache’ and ‘Syrup’ are through-composed like Jelly Roll Morton pieces,” he explains. “And some like ‘4 Cents’ and ‘Street’ and are more jammy, where we take a little idea — a line or a groove — and just develop it.” \n\n The rubato ballad “Helmland,” which features some particularly expressive slide trumpet work by Bernstein, carries a hymn-like feel while “Giant Minds” sounds like a requiem. Krauss and Scherr overdub guitars on “Valentino” and the raucous second-line groover “Golden Houses.” Krauss is featured on the free interlude “Lacy” and he’s turned loose on the edgy closer, “Briggan,” Says the leader, “Sometime it’s a little uncomfortable and jarring for people but that’s what Briggan does, that’s his thing. He’s a different kind of virtuoso.” Scherr is showcased on the African-influenced “Hear You” while “SF” pays tribute to Bernstein’s Bay Area roots. ”There were all these kind of psychedelic-blues hippie bands when I was growing up like Quicksilver Messenger Service, Sons of Champlin, The Loading Zone, Moby Grape. You’d hear those bands more than the Grateful Dead. So that’s what this song was about.”\n\nBernstein and his Sexmob crew continue to push the envelope in delightfully subversive ways on their fiercely independent, self-produced new outing, Cultural Capital.",

Kendl brings to The Lowest Pair her wonderfully weaving poetry of song, old and new, and a voice somewhere between Gillian Welch and Iris DeMent with a little Olympia twist. Palmer T. Lee who hails from Minneapolis was nineteen years old when he inherited a couple of banjos and discovered he could reassemble them into his dream instrument.

Since 1993, he's avoided AIDS by telling unsavory jokes in every English speaking country. Scott is trusting and thus surrounded by duplicity, yet he continues challenging himself, because he's physically challenged and emotionally unstable.\n\nDescribed by San Francisco Weekly (free press, edited by lesbians and designed by trannys with large hands and hidden agendas) as \"stand-up in the very best possible sense - deadpan, ever-alert and hilarious\" Scott has appeared in Mrs. Doubtfire, where, effortlessly, he played a homosexual; and Star Wars: Phantom Menace, where, breathlessly, he wore a body stocking.\n\nScott knows David Cameron (wink, wink) and Nelson Mandela. Well, he's met Nelson once. They're both vegetarians. Actually, Scott is. Nelson said he was, to impress Scott. Cameron eats anything.",

  "artistSummary": "Tony Lucca\nHe was cast by Justin Timberlake to play “the cool guy” in Timberlake’s directorial debut.\n\nHe finished third on The Voice in 2012, won a record deal in the process, and received more press coverage than any contestant on the show that season… or any season, for that matter.\n\nHe made a record with Adam Levine, then toured with Maroon 5 and Kelly Clarkson.\n\nHe was cast on the hit show “Parenthood” playing himself as a rock singer, and performed an original song.\n\nHe even starred in an Aaron Spelling prime-time drama and dated Keri Russell for years, winding up in countless gossip mags.\n\nHis name is Tony Lucca.\n\nSo why isn’t he a household name? Maybe he simply hadn’t made the right record before.\n\nThis time, Lucca believes he has. It’s his 8th full-length studio album, his first self-titled release, and first entirely self-produced effort.\n\n“We went in with the intention of making a record that was as live-sounding as possible. I wanted to close my eyes and be able to visualize the players in the room or up on the stage, actually playing the songs together. One guitar over here, the other guy over there, bass, drums, some keys? I mean, that’s the rock-n-roll I fell in love with when I was a kid.” Lucca pulls inspiration from the heroes he heard on the radio growing up, from Tom Petty, Billy Squier to AC/DC’s Angus Young, tapping into a sense of timelessness he places somewhere between The Black Crowes and the Black Keys.\n\nEach of the 12 songs on “Tony Lucca” are deeply personal. The record kicks off with “Old Girl”, Lucca’s rebuff to the music business treadmill. On the upbeat “Imagination”, Lucca recalls the evening where he met his wife… to the best of his ability. Lucca’s fans will enjoy the diverse sonic quality of four of his trademark ballads – the epic and sweeping piano-driven “North Star”, the optimistic “Smoke ‘Em”, the push and pull of love lost and found in “Right On Time”, and the sweet album closer that bares his daughter’s name, “Sparrow”.\n\nFunded by a very successful Kickstarter campaign (one that hit its $25K funding goal just inside of 30 hours), Lucca feels strongly that his fans stepped up so that he could make the best record he possibly could – one he could finally feel comfortable releasing with his own name as the title. To that point, Lucca says “this record is pure. And honest. And hopefully completely refreshing to its listeners.”\n\nTony Lucca was born on the outskirts of Detroit on the heels of Motown’s heyday, raised within the loving confines of an enormous family of musicians; his mom was the 10th of 12 kids who all sang and played. At the ripe old age of 12, Tony had his first paying gig as a musician at a Jr. High School dance and by the age of 15, he parlayed his childhood rock-n-roll fantasy into a legitimate career, getting cast among an extraordinary group of newcomers on The All New Mickey Mouse Club, along with Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling and Britney Spears.\n\nShortly after graduating high school, Lucca wound up in LA and embarked upon an independent recording career that would span over 20 years. Along the way he’s toured with artists as colossal as Maroon 5, Kelly Clarkson, *NSYNC and Marc Anthony, as well as several of his fellow Hotel Cafe kin including Josh Kelley, Sara Bareilles, Joey Ryan (Milk Carton Kids), Gabe Dixon and Andrew Belle. Lucca won the LA Music Award for best male singer/songwriter in 2001 and appeared numerous times on Last Call with Carson Daly, as well as The Wayne Brady Show and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Also in 2013, Lucca was the sole entertainment for FOX’s NFL Thanksgiving Day telecast for the Detroit Lions vs. Green Bay Packers game.",

The sun is at its highest and the singer/guitarist is embracing his new life in the light. On Go By Ocean’s second full length, McCaffrey and his troupe have harnessed its energy and the aptly titled Sun Machine radiates a message of hope and perseverance.\n\nFirst track Ring Around The Sun is symbolic of the year it took its creator’s eyes to adjust. A driving beat forms a solid backbone, over top of which McCaffrey grieves his past and sings his enthusiasm for the future. The song is a reminder that time is impermanent, a message which is matched by the track’s bright, upbeat vibe.",
